"28 November 2020, at 12:10","For the political term, see Benevolent dictatorship.Benevolent dictator for life (BDFL) is a title given to a small number of open-source software development leaders, typically project founders who retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community. The phrase originated in 1995 with reference to Guido van Rossum, creator of the Python programming language.[1][2] Shortly after Van Rossum joined the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, the term appeared in a follow-up mail by Ken Manheimer to a meeting trying to create a semi-formal group that would oversee Python development and workshops; this initial use included an additional joke of naming Van Rossum the ""First Interim BDFL"".[1] Van Rossum announced on July 12, 2018, that he would be stepping down as BDFL of Python.[3]BDFL should not be confused with the more common term for open-source leaders, ""benevolent dictator"", which was popularized by Eric S. Raymond's essay ""Homesteading the Noosphere"" (1999).[4] Among other topics related to hacker culture, Raymond elaborates on how the nature of open source forces the ""dictatorship"" to keep itself benevolent, since a strong disagreement can lead to the forking of the project under the rule of new leaders.

"28 July 2020, at 15:44","Computer programmer  Rich Hickey in San FranciscoRich Hickey is a computer programmer and speaker, known as the creator of the Clojure programming language. Clojure is a Lisp dialect built on top of the Java Virtual Machine.[1][2][3]  He also created or designed ClojureScript, the Extensible Data Notation (EDN) data format, and the Datomic distributed database. He is the chief technology officer at Cognitect.
Before Clojure, he developed dotLisp, a similar project based on the .NET Framework.[4] Hickey is an independent software developer and a consultant with over 20 years of experience in many facets of software development. He has worked on scheduling systems, broadcast automation, audio analysis and fingerprinting, database design, yield management, exit poll systems, and machine listening.[5]He spent about 2½ years working on Clojure before releasing it to the world, much of that time working exclusively on Clojure without external funding.

Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineeringpatterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.[4]Ruby on Rails' emergence in 2005 greatly influenced web app development, through innovative features such as seamless database table creations, migrations, and scaffolding of views to enable rapid application development. Ruby on Rails' influence on other web frameworks remains apparent today, with many frameworks in other languages borrowing its ideas, including Django in Python, Catalyst in Perl, Laravel and CakePHP in PHP, Grails in Groovy, Phoenix in Elixir, Play in Scala, and Sails.js in Node.js.

History[edit]David Heinemeier Hansson extracted Ruby on Rails from his work on the project management tool Basecamp at the web application company also called Basecamp (37Signals at the time).[6] Hansson first released Rails as open source in July 2004, but did not share commit rights to the project until February 2005.[citation needed] In August 2006, the framework reached a milestone when Apple announced that it would ship Ruby on Rails with Mac OS X v10.5 ""Leopard"",[7] which was released in October 2007.
Rails version 2.3 was released on March 15, 2009, with major new developments in templates, engines, Rack and nested model forms. Templates enable the developer to generate a skeleton application with custom gems and configurations. Engines give developers the ability to reuse application pieces complete with routes, view paths and models. The Rack web server interface and Metal allow one to write optimized pieces of code that route around Action Controller.[8]On December 23, 2008, Merb, another web application framework, was launched, and Ruby on Rails announced it would work with the Merb project to bring ""the best ideas of Merb"" into Rails 3, ending the ""unnecessary duplication"" across both communities.[9] Merb was merged with Rails as part of the Rails 3.0 release.[10][11]Rails 3.1 was released on August 31, 2011, featuring Reversible Database Migrations, Asset Pipeline, Streaming, jQuery as default JavaScript library and newly introduced CoffeeScript and Sass into the stack.[12]Rails 3.2 was released on January 20, 2012 with a faster development mode and routing engine (also known as Journey engine), Automatic Query Explain and Tagged Logging.[13] Rails 3.2.x is the last version that supports Ruby 1.8.7.[14] Rails 3.2.12 supports Ruby 2.0.[15]Rails 4.0 was released on June 25, 2013, introducing Russian Doll Caching, Turbolinks, Live Streaming as well as making Active Resource, Active Record Observer and other components optional by splitting them as gems.[16]Rails 4.1 was released on April 8, 2014, introducing Spring, Variants, Enums, Mailer previews, and secrets.yml.[17]Rails 4.2 was released on December 19, 2014, introducing Active Job, asynchronous emails, Adequate Record, Web Console, and foreign keys.[18]Rails 5.0 was released on June 30, 2016, introducing Action Cable, API mode, and Turbolinks 5.[19]Rails 5.0.0.1 was released on August 10, 2016, with Exclusive use of rails CLI over Rake and support for Ruby version 2.2.2 and above.
Rails 5.1 was released on April 27, 2017, introducing JavaScript integration changes (management of JavaScript dependencies from NPM via Yarn, optional compilation of JavaScript using Webpack, and a rewrite of Rails UJS to use vanilla JavaScript instead of depending on jQuery), system tests using Capybara, encrypted secrets, parameterized mailers, direct & resolved routes, and a unified form_with helper replacing the form_tag/form_for helpers.[20]Rails 5.2 was released on April 9, 2018, introducing new features that include ActiveStorage, built-in Redis Cache Store, updated Rails Credentials and a new DSL that allows for configuring a Content Security Policy for an application.[21]Rails 5.2.2 was released on December 4, 2018, introducing numerous bug fixes and several logic improvements.[22]Rails 6.0 was released on August 16, 2019, making Webpack default, adding mailbox routing, a default online rich-text editor, parallel testing, multiple database support, mailer routing and a new autoloader.[23]Version history

In a default configuration, a model in the Ruby on Rails framework maps to a table in a database and to a Ruby file. For example, a model class User will usually be defined in the file 'user.rb' in the app/models directory, and linked to the table 'users' in the database. While developers are free to ignore this convention and choose differing names for their models, files, and database table, this is not common practice and is usually discouraged in accordance with the ""convention-over-configuration"" philosophy.
A controller is a server-side component of Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application, by determining which view file to render. The controller may also have to query one or more models for information and pass these on to the view. For example, in an airline reservation system, a controller implementing a flight-search function would need to query a model representing individual flights to find flights matching the search, and might also need to query models representing airports and airlines to find related secondary data. The controller might then pass some subset of the flight data to the corresponding view, which would contain a mixture of static HTML and logic that use the flight data to create an HTML document containing a table with one row per flight. A controller may provide one or more actions. In Ruby on Rails, an action is typically a basic unit that describes how to respond to a specific external web-browser request. Also, note that the controller/action will be accessible for external web requests only if a corresponding route is mapped to it. Rails encourages developers to use RESTful routes, which include actions such as create, new, edit, update, destroy, show, and index. These mappings of incoming requests/routes to controller actions can be easily set up in the routes.rb configuration file.
A view in the default configuration of Rails is an erb file, which is evaluated and converted to HTML at run-time. Alternatively, many other templating systems can be used for views.
Ruby on Rails includes tools that make common development tasks easier ""out-of-the-box"", such as scaffolding that can automatically construct some of the models and views needed for a basic website.[36] Also included are WEBrick, a simple Ruby web server that is distributed with Ruby, and Rake, a build system, distributed as a gem. Together with Ruby on Rails, these tools provide a basic development environment.
Ruby on Rails is most commonly not connected to the Internet directly, but through some front-end web server. Mongrel was generally preferred[by whom?] over WEBrick in the early days,[citation needed] but it can also run on Lighttpd, Apache, Cherokee, Hiawatha, Nginx (either as a module – Phusion Passenger for example – or via CGI, FastCGI or mod_ruby), and many others. From 2008 onward, Passenger replaced Mongrel as the most-used web server for Ruby on Rails.[37] Ruby is also supported natively on the IBM i.[38]Ruby on Rails is also noteworthy for its extensive use of the JavaScript libraries, Prototype and Script.aculo.us, for scripting Ajax actions.[39] Ruby on Rails initially utilized lightweight SOAP for web services; this was later replaced by RESTful web services. Ruby on Rails 3.0 uses a technique called Unobtrusive JavaScript to separate the functionality (or logic) from the structure of the web page. jQuery is fully supported as a replacement for Prototype and is the default JavaScript library in Rails 3.1, reflecting an industry-wide move towards jQuery. Additionally, CoffeeScript was introduced in Rails 3.1 as the default JavaScript language.
Since version 2.0, Ruby on Rails offers both HTML and XML as standard output formats. The latter is the facility for RESTful web services.
Rails 3.1 introduced Sass as standard CSS templating.
By default, the server uses Embedded Ruby in the HTML views, with files having an html.erb extension.  Rails supports swapping-in alternative templating languages, such as HAML and Mustache.
Ruby on Rails 3.0 has been designed to work with Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9.2, and JRuby 1.5.2+; earlier versions are not supported.[40]Ruby on Rails 3.2 is the last series of releases that support Ruby 1.8.7.
Framework structure[edit]Ruby on Rails is separated into various packages, namely ActiveRecord (an object-relational mapping system for database access), Action Pack, Active Support and Action Mailer. Prior to version 2.0, Ruby on Rails also included the Action Web Service package that is now replaced by Active Resource. Apart from standard packages, developers can make plugins to extend existing packages. Earlier Rails supported plugins within their own custom framework; version 3.2 deprecates these in favor of standard Ruby ""gems"".[41]Deployment[edit]Ruby on Rails is often installed using RubyGems, a package manager[42] which is included with current versions of Ruby. Many free Unix-like systems also support installation of Ruby on Rails and its dependencies through their native package management system.
Ruby on Rails is typically deployed with a database server such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, and a web server such as Apache running the Phusion Passenger module.
Philosophy and design[edit]Ruby on Rails is intended to emphasize Convention over Configuration (CoC), and the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle.
""Convention over Configuration"" means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application. For example, if there is a class Sale in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called sales by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as calling the table ""products sold"", that the developer needs to write code regarding these names. Generally, Ruby on Rails conventions lead to less code and less repetition.[43]""Don't repeat yourself"" means that information is located in a single, unambiguous place. For example, using the ActiveRecord module of Rails, the developer does not need to specify database column names in class definitions. Instead, Ruby on Rails can retrieve this information from the database based on the class name.
""Fat models, skinny controllers"" means that most of the application logic should be placed within the model while leaving the controller as light as possible.
Trademarks[edit]In March 2007, David Heinemeier Hansson filed three Ruby on Rails-related trademark applications to the USPTO. These applications regard the phrase ""RUBY ON RAILS"",[44] the word ""RAILS"",[45] and the official Rails logo.[46] As a consequence, in the summer of 2007, Hansson denied permission to Apress to use the Ruby on Rails logo on the cover of a new Ruby on Rails book written by some authoritative community members. The episode gave rise to a polite protest in the Ruby on Rails community.[47][48] In response to this criticism, Hansson replied:
I only grant promotional use [of the Rails logo] for products I'm directly involved with. Such as books that I've been part of the development process for or conferences where I have a say in the execution. I would most definitely seek to enforce all the trademarks of Rails.[47]Reception[edit]Scalability[edit]Rails running on Matz's Ruby Interpreter (the de facto reference interpreter for Ruby) had been criticized for issues with scalability.[49] These critics often mentioned various Twitter outages in 2007 and 2008, which spurred Twitter's partial transition to Scala (which runs on the Java Virtual Machine) for their queueing system and other middleware.[50][51] The user interface aspects of the site continued to run Ruby on Rails[52] until 2011 when it was replaced due to concerns over performance[53]In 2011, Gartner Research noted that despite criticisms and comparisons to Java, many high-profile consumer web firms are using Ruby on Rails to build scalable web applications. Some of the largest sites running Ruby on Rails include Airbnb, Cookpad, GitHub, Scribd, Shopify, Hulu, and Basecamp.[54] As of January 2016, it is estimated that more than 1.2 million web sites are running Ruby on Rails.[55][56]Security[edit]In March 2012, security researcher Egor Homakov discovered a ""mass assignment"" vulnerability that allowed certain Rails applications to be remotely exploited, and demonstrated it by non-maliciously hacking GitHub after his earlier attempts at responsible disclosure were dismissed.[57]On September 24, 2013, a session cookie persistence security flaw was reported in Ruby on Rails. In a default configuration, the entire session hash is stored within a session cookie known as CookieStore, allowing any authenticated session possessing the session cookie to log in as the target user at any time in the future. As a workaround, administrators are advised to configure cookies to be stored on the server using mechanisms such as ActiveRecordStore.[58]Researchers Daniel Jackson and Joseph Near developed a data debugger they called ""Space"" that can analyze the data access of a Rails program and determine if the program properly adheres to rules regarding access restrictions. On April 15, 2016, Near reported that an analysis of 50 popular Web applications using Space uncovered 23 previously unknown security flaws.[59]References[edit]^""Rails 1.0: Party like it's one oh oh!"". weblog.rubyonrails.org.

Programming[edit]In 1999, Hansson founded and built a Danish online gaming news website and community called Daily Rush, which he ran until 2001.[4] After attracting the attention of Jason Fried by offering him help with PHP coding, Hansson was hired by Fried to build a web-based project management tool, which ultimately became 37signals' Basecampsoftware as a service product.[5] To aid the development process, Hansson used the then-obscure Ruby programming language to develop a custom web framework. He released the framework separately from the project management tool in 2004 as the open source project Ruby on Rails. In 2005, Hansson was recognized by Google and O'Reilly with the ""Hacker of the Year"" award for his creation of Ruby on Rails.[6] After graduating from the Copenhagen Business School and receiving his bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Business Administration, Hansson moved from Denmark to Chicago, Illinois, U.S. in November 2005.[7]Personal life[edit]24 Hours of Le Mans careerYears2012 -TeamsOAK Racing, Aston Martin Racing, Extreme Speed Motorsports, Proton Competition, Rebellion RacingBest finish8th (2013)Class wins1David Heinemeier Hansson lists photography and race car driving amongst his many hobbies.[8] During the post-race technical checks, certain irregularities were detected on the Vaillante Rebellion team's #13 Oreca 07-Gibson, resulting in the car's disqualification from the 2017 24 Hours of Le Mans. He took part in the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans driving for OAK Racing.[9] He also drove a Morgan-Nissan P2 car for Conquest Racing in the American Le Mans Series (ALMS), winning two races in the season. Heinemeier Hansson joined OAK Racing full-time in 2013, taking five 2nd-place finishes to finish 2nd in the Trophy for LMP2 Drivers. In July 2010 it was revealed that Heinemeier Hansson was the person that had commissioned the one-off Pagani Zonda HH supercar.[10] He also owns the one-off Koenigsegg Agera HH car.[11]24 Hours of Le Mans results[edit]

Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.
Up until version 2.3 Keras supported multiple backends, including TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, and PlaidML.[2][3][4] As of version 2.4, only TensorFlow is supported.  Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible. It was developed as part of the research effort of project ONEIROS (Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System),[5] and its primary author and maintainer is François Chollet, a Google engineer. Chollet also is the author of the XCeption deep neural network model.[6]Contents1Features2Traction3See also4References5External links

Features[edit]Keras contains numerous implementations of commonly used neural-network building blocks such as layers, objectives, activation functions, optimizers, and a host of tools to make working with image and text data easier to simplify the coding necessary for writing deep neural network code. The code is hosted on GitHub, and community support forums include the GitHub issues page, and a Slack channel.
In addition to standard neural networks, Keras has support for convolutional and recurrent neural networks. It supports other common utility layers like dropout, batch normalization, and pooling.[7]Keras allows users to productize deep models on smartphones (iOS and Android), on the web, or on the Java Virtual Machine.[3] It also allows use of distributed training of deep-learning models on clusters of Graphics processing units (GPU) and tensor processing units (TPU).[8]Traction[edit]Keras claims over 375,000 individual users as of early-2020.[3] Keras was the 10th most cited tool in the KDnuggets 2018 software poll and registered a 22% usage.[9]See also[edit]Comparison of deep-learning softwareReferences[edit]^""Release 2.4.0"". 17 June 2020.

Life and career[edit]Holovaty, a Ukrainian American, grew up in Naperville, Illinois and attended Naperville North High School. While serving as co-editor of the high school's newspaper, The North Star, a censored article about a faculty member sexually assaulting a student reignited an anti-censorship in the Illinois house of representatives.[1] He graduated from the Missouri School of Journalism in 2001 and worked as a web developer/journalist for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Lawrence Journal-World and The Washington Post before starting EveryBlock, a web startup that provided ""microlocal"" news, in 2007.[2]While working at the Lawrence Journal-World from 2002 to 2005, he and other web developers (Simon Willison, Jacob Kaplan-Moss and Wilson Miner[3]) created Django, an open sourceweb application framework for Python. He and Kaplan-Moss served as the framework's Benevolent Dictators for Life until January 2014.[4]  The pair wrote The Django Book, first published in 2007.
Holovaty is also a guitarist. In 1999, he recorded an album of his own guitar compositions,[5] and since 2007 he has posted videos of his acoustic guitar arrangements on YouTube, building an audience of more than 20,000 subscribers.[6] In 2012 he and PJ Macklin founded SoundSlice, a collaboratively edited website which shows YouTube music videos alongside simultaneous animated tablature, intended to help guitarists learn new musical pieces.[7]Crime mapping innovations[edit]In 2005, Holovaty launched chicagocrime.org, a Google Mapsmashup of Chicago Police Department crime data.[8] The site won the 2005 Batten Award for Innovations in Journalism[9] and was named by The New York Times as one of 2005's best ideas.[10]As one of the first Google Maps mashups, it helped influence Google to create its official Google Maps API.[11] Newspaper sites such as the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times have incorporated a map from EveryBlock, the successor to chicagocrime.org, into their web sites.[12]In 2007, Holovaty was awarded a $1.1 million Knight Foundation grant and left his job as editor of editorial innovations at washingtonpost.com to start EveryBlock, the successor to chicagocrime.org.[13] On August 17, 2009, EveryBlock was officially acquired by MSNBC.[14] The terms of the deal were not disclosed.[15]  In February 2013, NBC News announced that it was shutting down EveryBlock.[16] The service was re-launched by Comcast NBCUniversal in January, 2014 and now operates in Boston, Chicago, Denver, Fresno, Hialeah, Houston, Medford, Nashville, Philadelphia, and Seattle.[17] On July 19, 2018, EveryBlock was acquired by social networking serviceNextdoor and shut down.[18]References[edit]^""School Newspaper in Illinois Revives a Debate Over Censorship"". nytimes.com/.

Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and ""pluggability"" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself.[11] Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.
Some well known sites that use Django include PBS,[12]Instagram,[13]Mozilla,[14]The Washington Times,[15]Disqus,[16]Bitbucket,[17] and Nextdoor.[18]Contents1History2Features2.1Components2.2Bundled applications2.3Extensibility2.4Server arrangements3Version history4Development tools with Django support5Community6Ports to other languages7CMS's based on Django Framework8See also9References10Bibliography11External links

History[edit]Django was created in the fall of 2003, when the web programmers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper, Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, began using Python to build applications. Jacob Kaplan-Moss was hired early in Django's development shortly before Simon Willison's internship ended.[19] It was released publicly under a BSD license in July 2005. The framework was named after guitarist Django Reinhardt.[20] 
In June 2008, it was announced that a newly formed Django Software Foundation (DSF) would maintain Django in the future.[21]Features[edit]Components[edit]  Screenshot of the Django admin interface for modifying a user account.Despite having its own nomenclature, such as naming the callable objects generating the HTTP responses ""views"",[9] the core Django framework can be seen as an MVC architecture.[10] It consists of an object-relational mapper (ORM) that mediates between data models (defined as Python classes) and a relational database (""Model""), a system for processing HTTP requests with a web templating system (""View""), and a regular-expression-based URL dispatcher (""Controller"").
Also included in the core framework are:
a lightweight and standalone web server for development and testinga form serialization and validation system that can translate between HTML forms and values suitable for storage in the databasea template system that utilizes the concept of inheritance borrowed from object-oriented programminga caching framework that can use any of several cache methodssupport for middleware classes that can intervene at various stages of request processing and carry out custom functionsan internal dispatcher system that allows components of an application to communicate events to each other via pre-defined signalsan internationalization system, including translations of Django's own components into a variety of languagesa serialization system that can produce and read XML and/or JSON representations of Django model instancesa system for extending the capabilities of the template enginean interface to Python's built-in unit test frameworkBundled applications[edit]The main Django distribution also bundles a number of applications in its ""contrib"" package, including:
an extensible authentication systemthe dynamic administrative interfacetools for generating RSS and Atom syndication feedsa ""Sites"" framework that allows one Django installation to run multiple websites, each with their own content and applicationstools for generating Google Sitemapsbuilt-in mitigation for cross-site request forgery, cross-site scripting, SQL injection, password cracking and other typical web attacks, most of them turned on by default[22][23]a framework for creating GIS applicationsExtensibility[edit]This section relies too much on references to primary sources. Please improve this section by adding secondary or tertiary sources.  (January 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Django's configuration system allows third party code to be plugged into a regular project, provided that it follows the reusable app[24] conventions. More than 2500 packages[25] are available to extend the framework's original behavior, providing solutions to issues the original tool didn't tackle: registration, search, API provision and consumption, CMS, etc.
This extensibility is, however, mitigated by internal components' dependencies. While the Django philosophy implies loose coupling,[26] the template filters and tags assume one engine implementation, and both the auth and admin bundled applications require the use of the internal ORM. None of these filters or bundled apps are mandatory to run a Django project, but reusable apps tend to depend on them, encouraging developers to keep using the official stack in order to benefit fully from the apps ecosystem.
Server arrangements[edit]Django can be run in conjunction with Apache, Nginx using WSGI, Gunicorn, or Cherokee using flup (a Python module).[27][28] Django also includes the ability to launch a FastCGI server, enabling use behind any web server which supports FastCGI, such as Lighttpd or Hiawatha. It is also possible to use other WSGI-compliant web servers.[29] Django officially supports five database backends: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Oracle. Microsoft SQL Server can be used with django-mssql on Microsoftoperating systems,[30] while similarly external backends exist for IBM Db2,[31]SQL Anywhere[32] and Firebird.[33] There is a fork named django-nonrel, which supports NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB and Google App Engine's Datastore.[34]Django may also be run in conjunction with Jython on any Java EE application server such as GlassFish or JBoss. In this case django-jython must be installed in order to provide JDBC drivers for database connectivity, which also can provide functionality to compile Django in to a .war suitable for deployment.[35]Google App Engine includes support for Django version 1.x.x[36] as one of the bundled frameworks.
Version history[edit]The Django team will occasionally designate certain releases to be “long-term support” (LTS) releases.[37] LTS releases will get security and data loss fixes applied for a guaranteed period of time, typically 3+ years, regardless of the pace of releases afterwards.

Nevertheless, editors specialized on computer programming can help increase the productivity of development, e.g., with features such as syntax highlighting. Since Django is written in Python, text editors which are aware of Python syntax are beneficial in this regard.
Integrated development environments (IDE) add further functionality, such as debugging, refactoring, and unit testing. As with plain editors, IDEs with support for Python can be beneficial. Some IDEs that are specialized on Python additionally have integrated support for Django projects, so that using such an IDE when developing a Django project can help further increase productivity. For comparison of such Python IDEs, see the main article:
Main article: Comparison of integrated development environments § PythonCommunity[edit]There is a semiannual conference for Django developers and users, named ""DjangoCon"", that has been held since September 2008. DjangoCon is held annually in Europe, in May or June;[62] while another is held in the United States in August or September, in various cities.[63] The 2012 DjangoCon took place in Washington, D.C., from 3 to 8 September. 2013 DjangoCon was held in Chicago at the Hyatt Regency Hotel and the post-conference Sprints were hosted at Digital Bootcamp, computer training center.[64] The 2014 DjangoCon US returned to Portland, OR from 30 August to 6 September. The 2015 DjangoCon US was held in Austin, TX from 6 to 11 September at the AT&T Executive Center. The 2016 DjangoCon US was held in Philadelphia, PA at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania from 17 to 22 July.[65]The 2017 DjangoCon US was held in Spokane, WA;[66] in 2018 DjangoCon US was held in San Diego, CA.[67] DjangoCon US 2019 was held again in San Diego, CA from Sept 22–27.
Django mini-conferences are usually held every year as part of the Australian Python Conference 'PyCon AU'.[68] Previously, these mini-conferences have been held in:

Some of these options are more direct ports; others, though inspired by Django and retaining its concepts, take the liberty to deviate from Django's design:
Liquid for Ruby[72]Template::Swig for Perl[73]Twig for PHP and JavaScript[74][75]Jinja for Python[76]ErlyDTL for Erlang[77]CMS's based on Django Framework[edit]Django as framework is capable of building a CMS. However, there are a few CMS's already available which are built upon Django. Below is list of few of the CMS's built upon Django framework:

     (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Customer relationship management (CRM) is the process of managing interactions with existing as well as past and potential customers. It is one of many different approaches that allow a company to manage and analyse its own interactions with its past, current and potential customers.[1] It uses data analysis about customers' history with a company to improve business relationships with customers, specifically focusing on customer retention and ultimately driving sales growth.[2]One important aspect of the CRM approach is the systems of CRM compile data from a range of different communication channels, including a company's website, telephone, email, live chat, marketing materials and more recently, social media.[3] Through the CRM approach and the systems used to facilitate it, businesses learn more about their target audiences and how to best cater for their needs.

Software history[edit]The concept of customer relationship management started in the early 1970s, when customer satisfaction was evaluated using annual surveys or by front-line asking.[4] At that time, businesses had to rely on standalone mainframe systems to automate sales, but the extent of technology allowed them to categorize customers in spreadsheets and lists. In 1982, Kate and Robert D. Kestnbaum introduced the concept of Database marketing, namely applying statistical methods to analyze and gather customer data.[citation needed] By 1986, Pat Sullivan and Mike Muhney released a customer evaluation system called ACT! based on the principle of digital rolodex, which offered a contact management service for the first time.
The trend was followed by numerous companies and independent developers trying to maximize leads' potential, including Tom Siebel, who designed the first CRM product Siebel Systems in 1993.[5] In order to compete with these new and quickly growing stand-alone CRM solutions the established enterprise resource planning (ERP) software companies like Oracle, SAP,[6]Peoplesoft and Navision[7] started extending their sales, distribution and customer service capabilities with embedded CRM modules. This included embedding sales force automation or extended customer service (e.g. inquiry, activity management) as CRM features in their ERP.
Customer relationship management was popularized in 1997, due to the work of Siebel, Gartner, and IBM. Between 1997 and 2000, leading CRM products were enriched with shipping and marketing capabilities.[8] Siebel introduced the first mobile CRM app called Siebel Sales Handheld in 1999. The idea of a stand-alone, cloud-hosted and moveable customer bases was soon adopted by other leading providers at the time, including PeopleSoft, Oracle, SAP and Salesforce.com.[9]The first open-source CRM system was developed by SugarCRM in 2004. During this period, CRM was rapidly migrating to cloud, as a result of which it became accessible to sole entrepreneurs and small teams. This increase in accessibility generated a huge wave of price reduction.[8] Around 2009, developers began considering the options to profit from social media's momentum, and designed tools to help companies become accessible on all users' favorite networks. Many startups at the time benefited from this trend to provide exclusively social CRM solutions, including Base and Nutshell.[8] The same year, Gartner organized and held the first Customer Relationship Management Summit, and summarized the features systems should offer to be classified as CRM solutions.[10] In 2013 and 2014, most of the popular CRM products were linked to business intelligence systems and communication software to improve corporate communication and end-users' experience. The leading trend is to replace standardized CRM solutions with industry-specific ones, or to make them customizable enough to meet the needs of every business.[11] In November 2016, Forrester released a report where it ""identified the nine most significant CRM suites from eight prominent vendors"".[12]Types[edit]Strategic[edit]Strategic CRM is concentrated upon the development of a customer-centric business culture.[13]The focus of a business on being customer-centric (in design and implementation of their CRM strategy) will translate into an improved CLV. [14]Operational[edit]The primary goal of customer relationship management systems is to integrate and automate sales, marketing, and customer support. Therefore, these systems typically have a dashboard that gives an overall view of the three functions on a single customer view, a single page for each customer that a company may have. The dashboard may provide client information, past sales, previous marketing efforts, and more, summarizing all of the relationships between the customer and the firm. Operational CRM is made up of 3 main components: sales force automation, marketing automation, and service automation.[15]Sales force automation works with all stages in the sales cycle, from initially entering contact information to converting a prospective client into an actual client.[16] It implements sales promotion analysis, automates the tracking of a client's account history for repeated sales or future sales and coordinates sales, marketing, call centers, and retail outlets. It prevents duplicate efforts between a salesperson and a customer and also automatically tracks all contacts and follow-ups between both parties.[16][17]Marketing automation focuses on easing the overall marketing process to make it more effective and efficient. CRM tools with marketing automation capabilities can automate repeated tasks, for example, sending out automated marketing emails at certain times to customers, or posting marketing information on social media. The goal with marketing automation is to turn a sales lead into a full customer. CRM systems today also work on customer engagement through social media.[18]Service automation is the part of the CRM system that focuses on direct customer service technology. Through service automation, customers are supported through multiple channels such as phone, email, knowledge bases, ticketing portals, FAQs, and more.[15]Analytical[edit]The role of analytical CRM systems is to analyze customer data collected through multiple sources and present it so that business managers can make more informed decisions.[19] Analytical CRM systems use techniques such as data mining, correlation, and pattern recognition to analyze the customer data. These analytics help improve customer service by finding small problems which can be solved, perhaps by marketing to different parts of a consumer audience differently.[15] For example, through the analysis of a customer base's buying behavior, a company might see that this customer base has not been buying a lot of products recently. After scanning through this data, the company might think to market to this subset of consumers differently, in order to best communicate how this company's products might benefit this group specifically.[20]Collaborative[edit]The third primary aim of CRM systems is to incorporate external stakeholders such as suppliers, vendors, and distributors, and share customer information across groups/departments and organisations. For example, feedback can be collected from technical support calls, which could help provide direction for marketing products and services to that particular customer in the future.[21]Customer Data Platform[edit]Main article: Customer data platformA customer data platform (CDP) is a computer system used by marketing departments that assembles data about individual people from various sources into one database, with which other software systems can interact.[22]  As of February 2017 there were about twenty companies selling such systems and revenue for them was around US$300 million.[22]Components[edit]  Components in the different types of CRM[21]The main components of CRM are building and managing customer relationships through marketing, observing relationships as they mature through distinct phases, managing these relationships at each stage and recognizing that the distribution of value of a relationship to the firm is not homogeneous. When building and managing customer relationships through marketing, firms might benefit from using a variety of tools to help organizational design, incentive schemes, customer structures, and more to optimize the reach of its marketing campaigns. Through the acknowledgement of the distinct phases of CRM, businesses will be able to benefit from seeing the interaction of multiple relationships as connected transactions. The final factor of CRM highlights the importance of CRM through accounting for the profitability of customer relationships. Through studying the particular spending habits of customers, a firm may be able to dedicate different resources and amounts of attention to different types of consumers.[23]Relational Intelligence, or awareness of the variety of relationships a customer can have with a firm, is an important component to the main phases of CRM. Companies may be good at capturing demographic data, such as gender, age, income, and education, and connecting them with purchasing information to categorize customers into profitability tiers, but this is only a firm's mechanical view of customer relationships.[24] This therefore is a sign that firms believe that customers are still resources that can be used for up-sell or cross-sell opportunities, rather than humans looking for interesting and personalized interactions.[25]CRM systems include:
Data warehouse technology, used to aggregate transaction information, to merge the information with CRM products, and to provide key performance indicators.Opportunity management which helps the company to manage unpredictable growth and demand, and implement a good forecasting model to integrate sales history with sales projections.[26]CRM systems that track and measure marketing campaigns over multiple networks, tracking customer analysis by customer clicks and sales.Some CRM software is available as a software as a service (SaaS), delivered via the internet and accessed via a web browser instead of being installed on a local computer. Businesses using the software do not purchase it, but typically pay a recurring subscription fee to the software vendor.[15]For small businesses a CRM system may consist of a contact manager system that integrates emails, documents, jobs, faxes, and scheduling for individual accounts. CRM systems available for specific markets (legal, finance) frequently focus on event management and relationship tracking as opposed to financial return on investment (ROI).CRM systems for eCommerce, focused on marketing automation tasks, like: cart rescue, re-engage users with email, personalization.Customer-centric relationship management (CCRM) is a nascent sub-discipline that focuses on customer preferences instead of customer leverage. CCRM aims to add value by engaging customers in individual, interactive relationships.[23]Systems for non-profit and membership-based organizations help track constituents, fundraising, sponsors' demographics, membership levels, membership directories, volunteering and communication with individuals.CRM not only indicates to technology and strategy but also indicates to an integrated approach which includes employees knowledge, organizational culture to em-brass the CRM philosophy.Effect on customer satisfaction[edit]Customer satisfaction has important implications for the economic performance of firms because it has the ability to increase customer loyalty and usage behavior and reduce customer complaints and the likelihood of customer defection.[27][28] The implementation of a CRM approach is likely to have an effect on customer satisfaction and customer knowledge for a variety of different reasons.
Firstly, firms are able to customize their offerings for each customer.[29] By accumulating information across customer interactions and processing this information to discover hidden patterns, CRM applications help firms customize their offerings to suit the individual tastes of their customers.[29] This customization enhances the perceived quality of products and services from a customer's viewpoint, and because perceived quality is a determinant of customer satisfaction, it follows that CRM applications indirectly affect customer satisfaction. CRM applications also enable firms to provide timely, accurate processing of customer orders and requests and the ongoing management of customer accounts.[29] For example, Piccoli and Applegate discuss how Wyndham uses IT tools to deliver a consistent service experience across its various properties to a customer. Both an improved ability to customize and a reduced variability of the consumption experience enhance perceived quality, which in turn positively affects customer satisfaction.[30] Furthermore, CRM applications also help firms manage customer relationships more effectively across the stages of relationship initiation, maintenance, and termination.[31]Customer benefits[edit]With Customer relationship management systems, customers are served better on day to day process. With more reliable information, their demand for self service from companies will decrease. If there is less need to interact with the company for different problems, customer satisfaction level increases.[32] These central benefits of CRM will be connected hypothetically to the three kinds of equity that are relationship, value, and brand, and in the end to customer equity. Eight benefits were recognized to provide value drivers.[33]Enhanced ability to target profitable customers.Integrated assistance across channels.Enhanced sales force efficiency and effectiveness.Improved pricing.Customized products and services.Improved customer service efficiency and effectiveness.Individualized marketing messages also called campaigns.Connect customers and all channels on a single platform. In 2012, after reviewing the previous studies, someone selected some of those benefits which are more significant in customer's satisfaction and summarized them into the following cases:[34]Improve customer services: In general, customers would have some questions, concerns or requests. CRM services provide the ability to a company for producing, allocating and managing requests or something made by customers. For example, call center software, which helps to connect a customer to the manager or person who can best assist them with their existing problem, is one of the CRM abilities that can be implemented to increase efficiency.[35]Increased personalized service or one-to-one service: Personalizing customer service or one-to-one service provides companies to improve understanding and gaining knowledge of the customers and also to have better knowledge about their customers' preferences, requirements and demands.Responsive to customer's needs: Customers' situations and needs can be understood by the firms focusing on customer needs and requirements.[36]Customer segmentation: In CRM, segmentation is used to categorize customers, according to some similarity, such as industry, job or some other characteristics, into similar groups.[37] Although these characteristics, can be one or more attributes. It can be defined as a subdividing the customers based on already known good discriminator.Improve customization of marketing: Meaning of customization of marketing is that the firm or organization adapt and changes its services or products based on presenting a different and unique product or service for each customer. With the purpose of ensuring that customer needs and requirements are met Customization is used by the organization. Companies can put investment in information from customers and then customize their products or services to maintain customer interests.Multichannel integration: Multichannel integration shows the point of co-creation of customer value in CRM. On the other hand, a company's skill to perform multichannel integration successfully is heavily dependent on the organization's ability getting together customer information from all channels and incorporate it with other related information.[38]Time saving: CRM will let companies to interact with customers more frequently, by personalized message and communication way which can be produced rapidly and matched on a timely basis, and finally they can better understand their customers and therefore look forward to their needs.[39]Improve customer knowledge: Firms can make and improve products and services through the information from tracking (e.g. via website tracking) customer behavior to customer tastes and needs.[40] CRM could contribute to a competitive advantage in improving firm's ability of customer information collecting to customize products and services according to customer needs.Examples[edit]Research has found a 5% increase in customer retention boosts lifetime customer profits by 50% on average across multiple industries, as well as a boost of up to 90% within specific industries such as insurance.[41] Companies that have mastered customer relationship strategies have the most successful CRM programs. For example, MBNA Europe has had a 75% annual profit growth since 1995. The firm heavily invests in screening potential cardholders. Once proper clients are identified, the firm retains 97% of its profitable customers. They implement CRM by marketing the right products to the right customers. The firm's customers' card usage is 52% above industry norm, and the average expenditure is 30% more per transaction. Also 10% of their account holders ask for more information on cross-sale products.[41]Amazon has also seen great success through its customer proposition. The firm implemented personal greetings, collaborative filtering, and more for the customer. They also used CRM training for the employees to see up to 80% of customers repeat.[41]Customer profile[edit]Further information: Consumer behaviour, Biology and consumer behaviour, and Buying decisionCustomer or consumer profiles are the essence of the data that is collected alongside core data (name, address, company) and processed through customer analytics methods, essentially a type of profiling. A customer is abstracted to information that sums up consumption habits so far and projects them into the future so that they can be grouped for marketing and advertising purposes.[42]Improving CRM within a firm[edit]Consultants argue that it is important for companies establishing strong CRM systems to improve their relational intelligence.[43] According to this argument, a company must recognize that people have many different types of relationships with different brands. One research study analyzed relationships between consumers in China, Germany, Spain, and the United States, with over 200 brands in 11 industries including airlines, cars and media. This information is valuable as it provides demographic, behavioral, and value-based customer segmentation. These types of relationships can be both positive and negative. Some customers view themselves as friends of the brands, while others as enemies, and some are mixed with a love-hate relationship with the brand. Some relationships are distant, intimate or anything in between.[25]Analyzing the information[edit]Managers must understand the different reasons for the types of relationships, and provide the customer with what they are looking for. Companies can collect this information by using surveys, interviews, and more, with current customers. For example, Frito-Lay conducted many ethnographic interviews with customers to try and understand the relationships they wanted with the companies and the brands. They found that most customers were adults who used the product to feel more playful. They may have enjoyed the company's bright orange color, messiness, and shape.[44]Companies must also improve their relational intelligence of their CRM systems. These days, companies store and receive huge amounts of data through emails, online chat sessions, phone calls, and more.[45] Many companies do not properly make use of this great amount of data, however. All of these are signs of what types of relationships the customer wants with the firm, and therefore companies may consider investing more time and effort in building out their relational intelligence.[24] Companies can use data mining technologies and web searches to understand relational signals. Social media such as social networking sites, blogs, and forums can also be used to collect and analyze information. Understanding the customer and capturing this data allows companies to convert customer's signals into information and knowledge that the firm can use to understand a potential customer's desired relations with a brand.[44]Employee training[edit]Many firms have also implemented training programs to teach employees how to recognize and effectively create strong customer–brand relationships. For example, Harley Davidson sent its employees on the road with customers, who were motorcycle enthusiasts, to help solidify relationships. Other employees have also been trained in social psychology and the social sciences to help bolster strong customer relationships. Customer service representatives must be educated to value customer relationships and trained to understand existing customer profiles. Even the finance and legal departments should understand how to manage and build relationships with customers.[46]Application[edit]Applying new technologies while using CRM systems requires changes in infrastructure of the organization as well as deployment of new technologies such as business rules, databases and information technology.[44]In practice[edit]Call centers[edit]Contact center CRM providers are popular for small and mid-market businesses. These systems codify the interactions between company and customers by using analytics and key performance indicators to give the users information on where to focus their marketing and customer service. This allows agents to have access to a caller's history to provide personalized customer communication. The intention is to maximize average revenue per user, decrease churn rate and decrease idle and unproductive contact with the customers.[47][48][49]Growing in popularity is the idea of gamifying, or using game design elements and game principles in a non-game environment such as customer service environments. The gamification of customer service environments includes providing elements found in games like rewards and bonus points to customer service representatives as a method of feedback for a job well done.[50]Gamification tools can motivate agents by tapping into their desire for rewards, recognition, achievements, and competition.[51]Contact-center automation[edit]Contact-center automation, the practice of having an integrated system that coordinates contacts between an organization and the public, is designed to reduce the repetitive and tedious parts of a contact center agent's job. Automation prevents this by having pre-recorded audio messages that help customers solve their problems. For example, an automated contact center may be able to re-route a customer through a series of commands asking him or her to select a certain number in order to speak with a particular contact center agent who specializes in the field in which the customer has a question.[52] Software tools can also integrate with the agent's desktop tools to handle customer questions and requests. This also saves time on behalf of the employees.[18]Social media[edit]Social CRM involves the use of social media and technology to engage and learn from consumers.[53] Because the public, especially young people, are increasingly using social networking sites, companies use[25] these sites to draw attention to their products, services and brands, with the aim of building up customer relationships to increase demand.
Some CRM systems integrate social media sites like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook to track and communicate with customers. These customers also share their own opinions and experiences with a company's products and services, giving these firms more insight. Therefore, these firms can both share their own opinions and also track the opinions of their customers.[21]Enterprise feedback management software platforms combine internal survey data with trends identified through social media to allow businesses to make more accurate decisions on which products to supply.[54]Location-based services[edit]CRM systems can also include technologies that create geographic marketing campaigns. The systems take in information based on a customer's physical location and sometimes integrates it with popular location-based GPS applications. It can be used for networking or contact management as well to help increase sales based on location.[18]Business-to-business transactions[edit]Despite the general notion that CRM systems were created for customer-centric businesses, they can also be applied to B2B environments to streamline and improve customer management conditions. For the best level of CRM operation in a B2B environment, the software must be personalized and delivered at individual levels.[55]The main differences between business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business CRM systems concern aspects like sizing of contact databases and length of relationships.[56]CRM market[edit]The overall CRM market grew by 12.3 percent in 2015.[57] In 2018 it grew by 15.6% and reached $48.2 billion. The following table lists the top vendors in 2012-2018 (figures in millions of US dollars) published in Gartner studies.[57][58][59][60][61]

Other providers also are popular for small and mid market businesses. Splitting CRM providers into nine different categories (Enterprise CRM Suite, Midmarket CRM Suite, Small-Business CRM Suite, sales force automation, incentive management, marketing solutions, business intelligence, data quality, consultancies), each category has a different market leader. Additionally, applications often focus on professional fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, and other areas with branch-specific requirements.[citation needed]Market trends[edit]In the Gartner CRM Summit 2010 challenges like ""system tries to capture data from social networking traffic like Twitter, handles Facebook page addresses or other online social networking sites"" were discussed and solutions were provided that would help in bringing more clientele.[62] Many CRM vendors offer subscription-based web tools (cloud computing) and SaaS. Some CRM systems are equipped with mobile capabilities, making information accessible to remote sales staff.[63]Salesforce.com was the first company to provide enterprise applications through a web browser, and has maintained its leadership position.[64]Traditional providers have recently moved into the cloud-based market via acquisitions of smaller providers: Oracle purchased RightNow in October 2011[65] and SAP acquired SuccessFactors in December 2011.[66]The era of the ""social customer"" refers to the use of social media by customers.[67]Sales forces also play an important role in CRM, as maximizing sales effectiveness and increasing sales productivity is a driving force behind the adoption of CRM. Empowering sales managers was listed as one of the top 5 CRM trends in 2013.[68]Another related development is vendor relationship management (VRM), which provide tools and services that allow customers to manage their individual relationship with vendors. VRM development has grown out of efforts by ProjectVRM at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society and Identity Commons' Internet Identity Workshops, as well as by a growing number of startups and established companies. VRM was the subject of a cover story in the May 2010 issue of CRM Magazine.[69]Pharmaceutical companies were some of the first investors in sales force automation (SFA) and some are on their third- or fourth-generation implementations. However, until recently, the deployments did not extend beyond SFA—limiting their scope and interest to Gartner analysts.[70]Another trend worth noting is the rise of Customer Success as a discipline within companies. More and more companies establish Customer Success teams as separate from the traditional Sales team and task them with managing existing customer relations. This trend fuels demand for additional capabilities for more holistic understanding of the customer health, which is a limitation for many existing vendors in the space.[71] As a result, a growing number of new entrants enter the market, while existing vendors add capabilities in this area to their suites. In 2017, artificial intelligence and predictive analytics were identified as the newest trends in CRM.[72]Criticism[edit]See also: Anonymization and Customer rightsCompanies face large challenges when trying to implement CRM systems. Consumer companies frequently manage their customer relationships haphazardly and unprofitably.[73] They may not effectively or adequately use their connections with their customers, due to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of a CRM system's analysis. Clients who want to be treated more like a friend may be treated like just a party for exchange, rather than a unique individual, due to, occasionally, a lack of a bridge between the CRM data and the CRM analysis output. Many studies show that customers are frequently frustrated by a company's inability to meet their relationship expectations, and on the other side, companies do not always know how to translate the data they have gained from CRM software into a feasible action plan.[25] In 2003, a Gartner report estimated that more than $2 billion had been spent on software that was not being used. According to CSO Insights, less than 40 percent of 1,275 participating companies had end-user adoption rates above 90 percent.[74] Many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial or fragmented basis.[75] In a 2007 survey from the UK, four-fifths of senior executives reported that their biggest challenge is getting their staff to use the systems they had installed. Forty-three percent of respondents said they use less than half the functionality of their existing systems.[76] However, market research regarding consumers' preferences may increase the adoption of CRM among the developing countries' consumers.[77]Collection of customer data such as personally identifiable information must strictly obey customer privacylaws, which often requires extra expenditures on legal support.
Part of the paradox with CRM stems from the challenge of determining exactly what CRM is and what it can do for a company.[78] The CRM paradox, also referred to as the ""dark side of CRM"",[79] may entail favoritism and differential treatment of some customers.
CRM technologies can easily become ineffective if there is no proper management, and they are not implemented correctly. The data sets must also be connected, distributed, and organized properly, so that the users can access the information that they need quickly and easily. Research studies also show that customers are increasingly becoming dissatisfied with contact center experiences due to lags and wait times. They also request and demand multiple channels of communications with a company, and these channels must transfer information seamlessly. Therefore, it is increasingly important for companies to deliver a cross-channel customer experience that can be both consistent as well as reliable.[18]See also[edit].mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}Comparison of CRM systemsCorporate social responsibilityHistory of marketingRelationship marketingSocially responsible marketingSustainable market orientationVendor relationship managementReferences[edit]^Bardicchia, Marco (2020).

History and development process[edit]  Rich Hickey, creator of ClojureRich Hickey is the creator of the Clojure language.[17] Before Clojure, he developed dotLisp, a similar project based on the .NET platform,[28] and three earlier attempts to provide interoperability between Lisp and Java: a Java foreign language interface for Common Lisp (jfli),[29] A Foreign Object Interface for Lisp (FOIL),[30] and a Lisp-friendly interface to Java Servlets (Lisplets).[31]Hickey spent about 2½ years working on Clojure before releasing it publicly, much of that time working exclusively on Clojure with no outside funding. At the end of this time, Hickey sent an email announcing the language to some friends in the Common Lisp community.
The development process is community-driven[20] and is managed at the Clojure JIRA project page.[32] General development discussion occurs at the Clojure Google Group.[33] Anyone can submit issues and ideas at ask.clojure.org,[34] but to contribute patches, one must sign the Clojure Contributor agreement.[35] JIRA issues are processed by a team of screeners and finally Rich Hickey approves the changes.[36]Clojure's name, according to Hickey, is a pun on the programming concept ""closure"" incorporating the letters C, L, and J for C#, Lisp, and Java respectively—three languages which had a major influence on Clojure's design.[37]Design philosophy[edit]Rich Hickey developed Clojure because he wanted a modern Lisp for functional programming, symbiotic with the established Java platform, and designed for concurrency.[23][24][38][15]Clojure's approach to state is characterized by the concept of identities,[22] which are represented as a series of immutable states over time. Since states are immutable values, any number of workers can operate on them in parallel, and concurrency becomes a question of managing changes from one state to another. For this purpose, Clojure provides several mutable reference types, each having well-defined semantics for the transition between states.[22]Language overview[edit]Version

Legend:Old versionOlder version, still maintainedLatest versionLatest preview versionFuture releaseClojure runs on the Java platform and as a result, integrates with Java and fully supports calling Java code from Clojure,[52][15] and Clojure code can be called from Java, too.[53] The community uses Leiningen for project automation, providing support for Maven integration. Leiningen handles project package management and dependencies and is configured using Clojure syntax.[54]Like most other Lisps, Clojure's syntax is built on S-expressions that are first parsed into data structures by a reader before being compiled.[55][15] Clojure's reader supports literal syntax for maps, sets and vectors in addition to lists, and these are compiled to the mentioned structures directly.[55] Clojure is a Lisp-1 and is not intended to be code-compatible with other dialects of Lisp, since it uses its own set of data structures incompatible with other Lisps.[19]As a Lisp dialect, Clojure supports functions as first-class objects, a read–eval–print loop (REPL), and a macro system.[6] Clojure's Lisp macro system is very similar to that of Common Lisp with the exception that Clojure's version of the backquote (termed ""syntax quote"") qualifies symbols with their namespace. This helps prevent unintended name capture, as binding to namespace-qualified names is forbidden. It is possible to force a capturing macro expansion, but it must be done explicitly. Clojure does not allow user-defined reader macros, but the reader supports a more constrained form of syntactic extension.[56] Clojure supports multimethods[57] and for interface-like abstractions has a protocol[58] based polymorphism and data type system using records,[59] providing high-performance and dynamic polymorphism designed to avoid the expression problem.
Clojure has support for lazy sequences and encourages the principle of immutability and persistent data structures. As a functional language, emphasis is placed on recursion and higher-order functions instead of side-effect-based looping. Automatic tail call optimization is not supported as the JVM does not support it natively;[60][61][62] it is possible to do so explicitly by using the recur keyword.[63] For parallel and concurrent programming Clojure provides software transactional memory,[64] a reactive agent system,[1] and channel-based concurrent programming.[65]Clojure 1.7 introduced reader conditionals by allowing the embedding of Clojure and ClojureScript code in the same namespace.[48][55] Transducers were added as a method for composing transformations. Transducers enable higher-order functions such as map and fold to generalize over any source of input data. While traditionally these functions operate on sequences, transducers allow them to work on channels and let the user define their own models for transduction.[66][67][68]Alternate Platforms[edit]The primary platform of Clojure is Java,[18][52] but other target implementations exist. The most notable of these is ClojureScript,[69] which compiles to ECMAScript 3,[70] and ClojureCLR,[71] a full port on the .NET platform, interoperable with its ecosystem. A survey of the Clojure community with 1,060 respondents conducted in 2013[72] found that 47% of respondents used both Clojure and ClojureScript when working with Clojure. In 2014 this number had increased to 55%,[73] in 2015, based on 2,445 respondents, to 66%.[74] Popular ClojureScript projects include implementations of the React library such as Reagent,[75] re-frame,[76] Rum,[77] and Om.[78][79]Other Implementations[edit]Other implementations of Clojure on different platforms include:
CljPerl,[80] Clojure atop PerlClojerl,[81] Clojure on BEAM, the Erlang virtual machineclojure-py,[82] Clojure in pure PythonFerret,[83] compiles to self-contained C++11 that can run on microcontrollersJoker,[84] an interpreter and linter written in GoLas3r,[85] a subset of Clojure that runs on the ActionScript Virtual Machine (the Adobe Flash Player platform)Pixie,[86] Clojure-inspired Lisp dialect written in RPythonRouge,[87] Clojure atop YARV in RubyPopularity[edit]With continued interest in functional programming, Clojure's adoption by software developers using the Java platform has continued to increase. The language has also been recommended by software developers such as Brian Goetz,[88][89][90] Eric Evans,[91][92]James Gosling,[93]Paul Graham,[94] and Robert C. Martin.[95][96][97][98]ThoughtWorks, while assessing functional programming languages for their Technology Radar,[99] described Clojure as ""a simple, elegant implementation of Lisp on the JVM"" in 2010 and promoted its status to ""ADOPT"" in 2012.[100]In the ""JVM Ecosystem Report 2018"" (which was claimed to be ""the largest survey ever of Java developers""), that was prepared in collaboration by Snyk and Java Magazine, ranked Clojure as the 2nd most used programming language on the JVM for ""main applications"".[101] Clojure is used in industry by firms[102] such as Apple,[103][104]Atlassian,[105]Funding Circle,[106]Netflix,[107]Puppet,[108] and Walmart[109] as well as government agencies such as NASA.[110] It has also been used for creative computing, including visual art, music, games, and poetry.[111]Tools[edit]Tooling for Clojure development has seen significant improvement over the years. The following is a list of some popular IDEs and text editors with plug-ins that add support for programming in Clojure:[112]Atom, with Chlorine[113]Emacs, with CIDER[114]IntelliJ IDEA, with Clojure-Kit[115] or Cursive[116] (a free license is available for non-commercial use)Light TableVim, with fireplace.vim,[117][118] vim-iced,[119] or Conjure (Neovim only)[120][121]Visual Studio Code, with Calva[122]In addition to the tools provided by the community, the official Clojure CLI tools[123] have also become available on GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows since Clojure 1.9.[124]Features by example[edit]The following examples can be run in a Clojure REPL such as one started with the Clojure CLI tools[123] or an online REPL such as one available on REPL.it.[125]Simplicity[edit]Because of the strong emphasis on simplicity, typical Clojure programs consist of mostly functions and simple data structures (i.e., lists, vectors, maps, and sets):
;; A typical entry point of a Clojure program:;;   `-main` function(defn -main; name
  [&args]; (variable) parameters
  (println ""Hello, World!"")); bodyProgramming at the REPL[edit]Like other Lisps, one of the iconic features of Clojure is interactive programming at the REPL.[126] Note that, in the following examples, ;; starts a line comment and ;; => indicates the expected output:
;; define a var(def a42);; => #'user/a

;; call a function named `+`(+ a8);; => 50

;; call a function named `even?`(even?a);; => true

;; define a function that returns the remainder of `n` when divided by 10(defn foo[n](rem n10));; => #'user/foo

;; call the function(fooa);; => 2

;; print the docstring of `rem`(doc rem);; =>-------------------------clojure.core/rem([numdiv])
 remainderofdividingnumeratorbydenominator.

;; print the source of `rem`(sourcerem);; =>(defn rem
  ""remainder of dividing numerator by denominator.""
  {:added""1.0""
   :statictrue
   :inline(fn [xy]`(. clojure.lang.Numbers(remainder~x~y)))}
  [numdiv]
    (. clojure.lang.Numbers(remaindernumdiv)))Names at runtime[edit]Unlike other runtime environments where names get compiled away, Clojure's runtime environment is easily introspectable using normal Clojure data structures:
;; define a var(def a42);; => #'user/a

;; get a map of all public vars interned in the `user` namespace(ns-publics 'user);; => {a #'user/a}

;; reference the var via `#'` (reader macro) and;; its associated, namespace-qualified symbol `user/a`#'user/a;; => #'user/a

;; de-reference (get the value of) the var(deref #'user/a);; => 42

;; define a function (with a docstring) that;; returns the remainder of `n` when divided by 10(defn foo""returns `(rem n 10)`""[n](rem n10));; => #'user/foo

;; get the metadata of the var `#'user/foo`(meta #'user/foo);; =>{:arglists([n]),
 :doc""returns `(rem n 10)`"",
 :line1,
 :column1,
 :file""user.clj"",
 :namefoo,
 :ns#namespace[user]}Code as data (homoiconicity)[edit]Similar to other Lisps, Clojure is homoiconic (also known as code as data). In the example below, we can see how easy it is to write code that modifies code itself:
;; call a function (code)(+ 11);; => 2

;; quote the function call;; (turning code into data, which is a list of symbols)(quote (+ 11));; => (+ 1 1)

;; get the first element on the list;; (operating on code as data)(first (quote (+ 11)));; => +

;; get the last element on the list;; (operating on code as data)(last (quote (+ 11)));; => 1

;; get a new list by replacing the symbols on the original list;; (manipulating code as data)(map (fn [form]
       (caseform
         1'one
         + 'plus))
     (quote (+ 11)));; => (plus one one)Expressive operators for data transformation[edit]The threading macros (->, ->>, and friends) can syntactically express the abstraction of piping a collection of data through a series of transformations:
(->>(range 10)
     (map inc)
     (filter even?));; => (2 4 6 8 10)This can also be achieved more efficiently using transducers:
(sequence(comp (map inc)
                (filter even?))
          (range 10));; => (2 4 6 8 10)Thread-safe management of identity and state[edit]A thread-safe generator of unique serial numbers (though, like many other Lisp dialects, Clojure has a built-in gensym function that it uses internally):
(def i(atom0))

(defn generate-unique-id
  ""Returns a distinct numeric ID for each call.""
  []
  (swap!iinc))Macros[edit]An anonymous subclass of java.io.Writer that doesn't write to anything, and a macro using it to silence all prints within it:
(def bit-bucket-writer
  (proxy [java.io.Writer][]
    (write[buf]nil)
    (close[]    nil)
    (flush []    nil)))

(defmacro noprint
  ""Evaluates the given `forms` with all printing to `*out*` silenced.""
  [&forms]
  `(binding [*out*bit-bucket-writer]
     ~@forms))

(noprint
  (println ""Hello, nobody!""));; => nilLanguage interoperability with Java[edit]Clojure was created from the ground up to embrace its host platforms as one of its design goals and thus provides excellent language interoperability with Java:
;; call an instance method(.toUpperCase""apple"");; => ""APPLE""

;; call a static method(System/getProperty""java.vm.version"");; => ""12+33""

;; create an instance of `java.util.HashMap` and;; add some entries(doto (java.util.HashMap.)
  (.put""apple""1)
  (.put""banana""2));; => {""banana"" 2, ""apple"" 1}

;; create an instance of `java.util.ArrayList` and;; increment its elements with `clojure.core/map`(def al(doto (java.util.ArrayList.)
          (.add1)
          (.add2)
          (.add3)))

(map inc al);; => (2 3 4)

;; show a message dialog using Java Swing(javax.swing.JOptionPane/showMessageDialog
  nil
  ""Hello, World!"");; => nilSoftware transactional memory[edit]10 threads manipulating one shared data structure, which consists of 100 vectors each one containing 10 (initially sequential) unique numbers. Each thread then repeatedly selects two random positions in two random vectors and swaps them. All changes to the vectors occur in transactions by making use of Clojure's software transactional memory system:
(defn run
  [nvecsnitemsnthreadsniters]
  (let [vec-refs
        (->>(* nvecsnitems)
             (range)
             (into [](comp (partition-allnitems)
                            (map vec)
                            (map ref))))

        swap
        #(let [v1(rand-int nvecs)
               v2(rand-int nvecs)
               i1(rand-int nitems)
               i2(rand-int nitems)]
          (dosync
            (let [tmp(nth @(vec-refsv1)i1)]
              (alter (vec-refsv1)assoc i1(nth @(vec-refsv2)i2))
              (alter (vec-refsv2)assoc i2tmp))))

        report
        #(->>vec-refs
              (into [](comp (map deref)
                             (map (fn [v](prn v)v))
                             cat
                             (distinct)))
              (count)
              (println ""Distinct:""))]

    (report)

    (->>#(dotimes [_niters](swap))

   / July 11, 2020; 5 months ago (2020-07-11)Repositorysourceforge.net/projects/dolibarr/files/Written inPHPOperating systemCross-platformTypeERP, CRM, Accounting, SaaSLicenseGNU General Public License 3.0Websitewww.dolibarr.orgDolibarr ERP CRM is an open source, free software package for companies of any size, foundations or freelancers. It includes different features for enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) but also other features for different activities.[1]Contents1Features1.1Main modules1.2Miscellaneous1.3Missing features2Architecture3History4Awards5See also6References7External links

Features[edit]There are several feature modules that can be enabled or disabled, as needed.
This software is free under GNU General Public License 3.0. It is a web-based application, and can therefore be used wherever an internet service is available.
Dolibarr aims to offer free open source ERP and CRM features for people with no technical knowledge, by providing a simple solution.[2]Dolibarr includes all the important features of an ERP CRM suite. It is modular and is thus characterized by its ease of installation and use, despite the large number of features.[3]Main Dolibarr features include:

This means you need to install the software twice if you want to manage two different companies or install external addons.[6]No human resource management.No Webmail (not to be confused with a mailing-list).Architecture[edit]Dolibarr is written in PHP. It uses MySQL, MariaDB or PostgreSQL databases.
It works with a wide choice of hosting services or servers. Dolibarr works with all PHP configurations and does not require any additional PHP modules.
Dolibarr can also be installed from an auto-installer file that is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. This is aimed at enabling users with no technical knowledge to install Dolibarr and its prerequisites (such as Apache, MySQL and PHP). This version is called DoliWamp for Windows users, DoliDeb for Debian or Ubuntu users, DoliRpm for Fedora, Redhat, Mandriva or OpenSuse users.
History[edit]Dolibarr was started by Rodolphe Quiedeville in April 2002. At this time, Jean-Louis Bergamo began writing the foundation management module. Version 1.0 was released in September 2003.
In July 2008, Laurent Destailleur - the main contributor and author of AWStats - took over from Rodolphe Quideville as the main developer.[7] A foundation and several user groups have been created in several countries. The first was set up in France, the country where Dolibarr is most well-known.[8] Dolibarr's popularity in France increased after it was freely distributed by a number of government agencies to people starting up new businesses.[9] The software is now also used in many other countries and translated into more than 50 languages.[10]Awards[edit]20031st in the category ""Management Company"" at the [Les Trophées du Libre]] contest.[11]2014, 2015, 2016Several times project of the week (March 2014,[12] September 2015,[13] September 2016 [14]...)2020Project of the month December 2020[15]See also[edit].mw-parser-output .portal{border:solid #aaa 1px;padding:0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tleft{margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tright{margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul{display:table;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0.1em;max-width:175px;background:#f9f9f9;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li{display:table-row}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:first-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:last-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle}Free and open-source software portalComparison of accounting softwareOther ERP/CRM software: Odoo, Compiere, OpenbravoList of free and open source software packagesList of applications with iCalendar supportReferences[edit]^""Main Dolibarr features on Dolibarr official web site"". www.dolibarr.org. 2008-08-01.

ERP is usually referred to as a category of business management software—typically a suite of integrated applications—that an organization can use to collect, store, manage, and interpret data from many business activities.
ERP provides an integrated and continuously updated view of core business processes using common databases maintained by a database management system. ERP systems track business resources—cash, raw materials, production capacity—and the status of business commitments: orders, purchase orders, and payroll. The applications that make up the system share data across various departments (manufacturing, purchasing, sales, accounting, etc.) that provide the data.[1] ERP facilitates information flow between all business functions and manages connections to outside stakeholders.[2]Enterprise system software is a multibillion-dollar industry that produces components supporting a variety of business functions. IT investments have, as of 2011, become one of the largest categories of capital expenditure in United States-based businesses. Though early ERP systems focused on large enterprises, smaller enterprises increasingly use ERP systems.[3]The ERP system integrates varied organizational systems and facilitates error-free transactions and production, thereby enhancing the organization's efficiency. However, developing an ERP system differs from traditional system development.[4]
ERP systems run on a variety of computer hardware and network configurations, typically using a database as an information repository.[5]Contents1Origin2Expansion3Characteristics4Functional areas4.1GRP5Best practices6Connectivity to plant floor information7Implementation7.1Process preparation7.2Configuration7.3Two-tier enterprise resource planning7.4Customization7.5Extensions7.6Data migration7.7Advantages7.8Benefits7.9Disadvantages8Postmodern ERP9See also10References11Bibliography12External links

Origin[edit]The Gartner Group first used the acronym ERP in the 1990s[6][7] to include the capabilities of material requirements planning (MRP), and the later manufacturing resource planning (MRP II),[8][9] as well as computer-integrated manufacturing. Without replacing these terms, ERP came to represent a larger whole that reflected the evolution of application integration beyond manufacturing.[10]Not all ERP packages are developed from a manufacturing core; ERP vendors variously began assembling their packages with finance-and-accounting, maintenance, and human-resource components. By the mid-1990s ERP systems addressed all core enterprise functions. Governments and non–profit organizations also began to use ERP systems.[11]Expansion[edit]ERP systems experienced rapid growth in the 1990s. Because of the year 2000 problem many companies took the opportunity to replace their old systems with ERP.[12]ERP systems initially focused on automating back office functions that did not directly affect customers and the public. Front office functions, such as customer relationship management (CRM), dealt directly with customers, or e-business systems such as e-commerce, e-government, e-telecom, and e-finance—or supplier relationship management (SRM) became integrated later, when the internet simplified communicating with external parties.[13]""ERP II"" was coined in 2000 in an article by Gartner Publications entitled ERP Is Dead—Long Live ERP II.[14][15] It describes web–based software that provides real–time access to ERP systems to employees and partners (such as suppliers and customers). The ERP II role expands traditional ERP resource optimization and transaction processing. Rather than just manage buying, selling, etc.—ERP II leverages information in the resources under its management to help the enterprise collaborate with other enterprises.[16]
ERP II is more flexible than the first generation ERP. Rather than confine ERP system capabilities within the organization, it goes beyond the corporate walls to interact with other systems. Enterprise application suite is an alternate name for such systems. ERP II systems are typically used to enable collaborative initiatives such as supply chain management (SCM), customer relationship management (CRM), and business intelligence (BI) among business partner organizations through the use of various e-business technologies.[17][18]Developers now make more effort to integrate mobile devices with the ERP system. ERP vendors are extending ERP to these devices, along with other business applications. Technical stakes of modern ERP concern integration—hardware, applications, networking, supply chains. ERP now covers more functions and roles—including decision making, stakeholders' relationships, standardization, transparency, globalization, etc.[19]Characteristics[edit]ERP  systems typically include the following characteristics:
An integrated systemOperates in (or near) real timeA common database that supports all the applicationsA consistent look and feel across modulesInstallation of the system with elaborate application/data integration by the Information Technology (IT) department, provided the implementation is not done in small steps[20]Deployment options include: on-premises, cloud hosted, or SaaSFunctional areas[edit]An ERP system covers the following common functional areas. In many ERP systems, these are called and grouped together as ERP modules:
Financial accounting: general ledger, fixed assets, payables including vouchering, matching and payment, receivables and collections, cash management, financial consolidationManagement accounting: budgeting, costing, cost management, activity based costingHuman resources: recruiting, training, rostering, payroll, benefits, retirement and pension plans, diversity management, retirement, separationManufacturing: engineering, bill of materials, work orders, scheduling, capacity, workflow management, quality control, manufacturing process, manufacturing projects, manufacturing flow,  product life cycle managementOrder processing: order to cash, order entry, credit checking, pricing, available to promise, inventory, shipping, sales analysis and reporting, sales commissioningSupply chain management: supply chain planning, supplier scheduling, product configurator, order to cash, purchasing, inventory, claim processing, warehousing (receiving, putaway, picking and packing)Project management: project planning, resource planning, project costing, work breakdown structure, billing, time and expense, performance units, activity managementCustomer relationship management (CRM): sales and marketing, commissions, service, customer contact, call center support – CRM systems are not always considered part of ERP systems but rather business support systems (BSS)Data services: various ""self–service"" interfaces for customers, suppliers and/or employeesGRP[edit]Government resource planning (GRP) is the equivalent of an ERP for the public sector and an  integrated office automation system for government bodies.[21] The software structure, modularization, core algorithms and main interfaces do not differ from other ERPs, and ERP software suppliers manage to adapt their systems to government agencies.[22][23][24]Both system implementations, in private and public organizations, are adopted to improve productivity and overall business performance in organizations, but comparisons (private vs. public) of implementations shows that the main factors influencing ERP implementation success in the public sector are cultural.[25][26][27]Best practices[edit]Most ERP systems incorporate best practices. This means the software reflects the vendor's interpretation of the most effective way to perform each business process. Systems vary in how conveniently the customer can modify these practices.[28] In addition, best practices reduced risk by 71% compared to other software implementations.[29]Use of best practices eases compliance with requirements such as IFRS, Sarbanes-Oxley, or Basel II. They can also help comply with de facto industry standards, such as electronic funds transfer. This is because the procedure can be readily codified within the ERP software and replicated with confidence across multiple businesses that share that business requirement.[30][31]Connectivity to plant floor information[edit]ERP systems connect to real–time data and transaction data in a variety of ways. These systems are typically configured by systems integrators, who bring unique knowledge on process, equipment, and vendor solutions.
Direct integration—ERP systems have connectivity (communications to plant floor equipment) as part of their product offering. This requires that the vendors offer specific support for the plant floor equipment their customers operate. 
Database integration—ERP systems connect to plant floor data sources through staging tables in a database. Plant floor systems deposit the necessary information into the database. The ERP system reads the information in the table. The benefit of staging is that ERP vendors do not need to master the complexities of equipment integration. Connectivity becomes the responsibility of the systems integrator.
Enterprise appliance transaction modules (EATM)—These devices communicate directly with plant floor equipment and with the ERP system via methods supported by the ERP system. EATM can employ a staging table, web services, or system–specific program interfaces (APIs). An EATM offers the benefit of being an off–the–shelf solution.
Custom–integration solutions—Many system integrators offer custom solutions. These systems tend to have the highest level of initial integration cost, and can have a higher long term maintenance and reliability costs. Long term costs can be minimized through careful system testing and thorough documentation. Custom–integrated solutions typically run on workstation or server-class computers.
Implementation[edit]ERP's scope usually implies significant changes to staff work processes and practices.[32] Generally, three types of services are available to help implement such changes—consulting, customization, and support.[32] Implementation time depends on business size, number of modules, customization, the scope of process changes, and the readiness of the customer to take ownership for the project. Modular ERP systems can be implemented in stages. The typical project for a large enterprise takes about 14 months and requires around 150 consultants.[33] Small projects can require months; multinational and other large implementations can take years.[34][35]Customization can substantially increase implementation times.[33]Besides that, information processing influences various business functions e.g. some large corporations like Wal-Mart use a just in time inventory system. This reduces inventory storage and increases delivery efficiency, and requires up-to-date data. Before 2014, Walmart used a system called Inforem developed by IBM to manage replenishment.[36]Process preparation[edit]Implementing ERP typically requires changes in existing business processes.[37] Poor understanding of needed process changes prior to starting implementation is a main reason for project failure.[38] The difficulties could be related to the system, business process, infrastructure, training, or lack of motivation.
It is therefore crucial that organizations thoroughly analyze business processes before they implement ERP software. Analysis can identify opportunities for process modernization. It also enables an assessment of the alignment of current processes with those provided by the ERP system. Research indicates that risk of business process mismatch is decreased by:
Linking current processes to the organization's strategyAnalyzing the effectiveness of each processUnderstanding existing automated solutions[39][40]ERP implementation is considerably more difficult (and politically charged) in decentralized organizations, because they often have different processes, business rules, data semantics, authorization hierarchies, and decision centers.[41] This may require migrating some business units before others, delaying implementation to work through the necessary changes for each unit, possibly reducing integration (e.g., linking via Master data management) or customizing the system to meet specific needs.[42]A potential disadvantage is that adopting ""standard"" processes can lead to a loss of competitive advantage. While this has happened, losses in one area are often offset by gains in other areas, increasing overall competitive advantage.[43][44]Configuration[edit]Configuring an ERP system is largely a matter of balancing the way the organization wants the system to work with the way it was designed to work. ERP systems typically include many settings that modify system operations. For example, an organization can select the type of inventory accounting—FIFO or LIFO—to use; whether to recognize revenue by geographical unit, product line, or distribution channel; and whether to pay for shipping costs on customer returns.[42]Two-tier enterprise resource planning[edit]Two-tier ERP software and hardware lets companies run the equivalent of two ERP systems at once: one at the corporate level and one at the division or subsidiary level. For example, a manufacturing company could use an ERP system to manage across the organization using independent global or regional distribution, production or sales centers, and service providers to support the main company's customers. Each independent center (or) subsidiary may have its own business models, workflows, and business processes.
Given the realities of globalization, enterprises continuously evaluate how to optimize their regional, divisional, and product or manufacturing strategies to support strategic goals and reduce time-to-market while increasing profitability and delivering value.[45] With two-tier ERP, the regional distribution, production, or sales centers and service providers continue operating under their own business model—separate from the main company, using their own ERP systems. Since these smaller companies' processes and workflows are not tied to main company's processes and workflows, they can respond to local business requirements in multiple locations.[46]Factors that affect enterprises' adoption of two-tier ERP systems include:
Manufacturing globalization, the economics of sourcing in emerging economiesPotential for quicker, less costly ERP implementations at subsidiaries, based on selecting software more suited to smaller companiesExtra effort, (often involving the use of Enterprise application integration) is required where data must pass between two ERP systems[47] Two-tier ERP strategies give enterprises agility in responding to market demands and in aligning IT systems at a corporate level while inevitably resulting in more systems as compared to one ERP system used throughout the organization.[48]Customization[edit]ERP systems are theoretically based on industry best practices, and their makers intend that organizations deploy them ""as is"".[49][50]  ERP vendors do offer customers configuration options that let organizations incorporate their own business rules, but gaps in features often remain even after configuration is complete.
ERP customers have several options to reconcile feature gaps, each with their own pros/cons. Technical solutions include rewriting part of the delivered software, writing a homegrown module to work within the ERP system, or interfacing to an external system. These three options constitute varying degrees of system customization—with the first being the most invasive and costly to maintain.[51] Alternatively, there are non-technical options such as changing business practices or organizational policies to better match the delivered ERP feature set. Key differences between customization and configuration include:
Customization is always optional, whereas the software must always be configured before use (e.g., setting up cost/profit center structures, organizational trees, purchase approval rules, etc.).The software is designed to handle various configurations and behaves predictably in any allowed configuration.The effect of configuration changes on system behavior and performance is predictable and is the responsibility of the ERP vendor. The effect of customization is less predictable. It is the customer's responsibility, and increases testing activities.Configuration changes survive upgrades to new software versions. Some customizations (e.g., code that uses pre–defined ""hooks"" that are called before/after displaying data screens) survive upgrades, though they require retesting. Other customizations (e.g., those involving changes to fundamental data structures) are overwritten during upgrades and must be re-implemented.[52]Customization advantages include that it:
Improves user acceptance[53]Offers the potential to obtain competitive advantage vis-à-vis companies using only standard featuresCustomization disadvantages include that it may:
Increase time and resources required to implement and maintain[51][54]Hinder seamless interfacing/integration between suppliers and customers due to the differences between systems[54]Limit the company's ability to upgrade the ERP software in the future[54]Create overreliance on customization, undermining the principles of ERP as a standardizing software platformExtensions[edit]ERP systems can be extended with third–party software, often via vendor-supplied interfaces.[55][56] Extensions offer features such as:[56]product data managementproduct life cycle managementcustomer relations managementdata mininge-procurementData migration[edit]Data migration is the process of moving, copying, and restructuring data from an existing system to the ERP system. Migration is critical to implementation success and requires significant planning. Unfortunately, since migration is one of the final activities before the production phase, it often receives insufficient attention. The following steps can structure migration planning:[57]Identify the data to be migrated.Determine the migration timing.Generate data migration templates for key data componentsFreeze the toolset.Decide on the migration-related setup of key business accounts.Define data archiving policies and procedures.Often, data migration is incomplete because some of the data in the existing system is either incompatible or not needed in the new system. As such, the existing system may need to be kept as an archived database to refer back to once the new ERP system is in place.[57]Advantages[edit]The most fundamental advantage of ERP is that the integration of a myriad of business processes saves time and expense. Management can make decisions faster and with fewer errors. Data becomes visible across the organization. Tasks that benefit from this integration include:[58]Sales forecasting, which allows inventory optimization.Chronological history of every transaction through relevant data compilation in every area of operation.Order tracking, from acceptance through fulfillmentRevenue tracking, from invoice through cash receiptMatching purchase orders (what was ordered), inventory receipts (what arrived), and costing (what the vendor invoiced)ERP systems centralize business data, which:
Eliminates the need to synchronize changes between multiple systems—consolidation of finance, marketing, sales, human resource, and manufacturing applications[citation needed]Brings legitimacy and transparency to each bit of statistical dataFacilitates standard product naming/codingProvides a comprehensive enterprise view (no ""islands of information""), making real–time information available to management anywhere, anytime to make proper decisionsProtects sensitive data by consolidating multiple security systems into a single structure[59]Benefits[edit]ERP creates a more agile company that adapts better to change. It also makes a company more flexible and less rigidly structured so organization components operate more cohesively, enhancing the business—internally and externally.[60]ERP can improve data security in a closed environment. A common control system, such as the kind offered by ERP systems, allows organizations the ability to more easily ensure key company data is not compromised. This changes, however, with a more open environment, requiring further scrutiny of ERP security features and internal company policies regarding security.[61]ERP provides increased opportunities for collaboration. Data takes many forms in the modern enterprise, including documents, files, forms, audio and video, and emails. Often, each data medium has its own mechanism for allowing collaboration. ERP provides a collaborative platform that lets employees spend more time collaborating on content rather than mastering the learning curve of communicating in various formats across distributed systems.[56]ERP offers many benefits such as standardization of common processes, one integrated system, standardized reporting, improved key performance indicators (KPI), and access to common data. One of the key benefits of ERP; the concept of integrated system, is often misinterpreted by the business. ERP is a centralized system that provides tight integration with all major enterprise functions be it HR, planning, procurement, sales, customer relations, finance or analytics, as well to other connected application functions. In that sense ERP could be described as ""Centralized Integrated Enterprise System (CIES)""[62]Disadvantages[edit]Customization can be problematic. Compared to the best-of-breed approach, ERP can be seen as meeting an organization's lowest common denominator needs, forcing the organization to find workarounds to meet unique demands.[63]Re-engineering business processes to fit the ERP system may damage competitiveness or divert focus from other critical activities.ERP can cost more than less integrated or less comprehensive solutions.High ERP switching costs can increase the ERP vendor's negotiating power, which can increase support, maintenance, and upgrade expenses.Overcoming resistance to sharing sensitive information between departments can divert management attention.Integration of truly independent businesses can create unnecessary dependencies.Extensive training requirements take resources from daily operations.Harmonization of ERP systems can be a mammoth task (especially for big companies) and requires a lot of time, planning, and money.[64]Critical challenges include disbanding the project team very quickly after implementation, interface issues, lack of proper testing, time zone limitations, stress, offshoring, people's resistance to change, a short hyper-care period, and data cleansing.[65]Postmodern ERP[edit]The term ""postmodern ERP"" was coined by Gartner in 2013, when it first appeared in the paper series ""Predicts 2014"".[66] According to Gartner's definition of the postmodern ERP strategy, legacy, monolithic and highly customized ERP suites, in which all parts are heavily reliant on each other, should sooner or later be replaced by a mixture of both cloud-based and on-premises applications, which are more loosely coupled and can be easily exchanged if needed.
The basic idea is that there should still be a core ERP solution that would cover most important business functions, while other functions will be covered by specialist software solutions that merely extend the core ERP. This concept is similar to the so-called best-of-breed approach[67] to software execution, but it shouldn't be confused with it. While in both cases, applications that make up the whole are relatively loosely connected and quite easily interchangeable, in the case of the latter there is no ERP solution whatsoever. Instead, every business function is covered by a separate software solution.[68]There is, however, no golden rule as to what business functions should be part of the core ERP, and what should be covered by supplementary solutions. According to Gartner, every company must define their own postmodern ERP strategy, based on company's internal and external needs, operations and processes. For example, a company may define that the core ERP solution should cover those business processes that must stay behind the firewall, and therefore, choose to leave their core ERP on-premises. At the same time, another company may decide to host the core ERP solution in the cloud and move only a few ERP modules as supplementary solutions to on-premises.[68]The main benefits that companies will gain from implementing postmodern ERP strategy are speed and flexibility when reacting to unexpected changes in business processes or on the organizational level.[69] With the majority of applications having a relatively loose connection, it is fairly easy to replace or upgrade them whenever necessary. In addition to that, following the examples above, companies can select and combine cloud-based and on-premises solutions that are most suited for their ERP needs. The downside of postmodern ERP is that it will most likely lead to an increased number of software vendors that companies will have to manage, as well as pose additional integration challenges for the central IT.[68][70]See also[edit].mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}List of ERP software packagesAccounting softwareBill of resourcesBusiness process managementBusiness intelligenceCost accountingCyberneticsDocument automationData migrationEconomic planningEnterprise feedback management (EFM)Enterprise planning systemsEnterprise systemERP modelingERP system selection methodologyInformation technology managementList of project management softwareManagement information systemManufacturing operations managementMaterial balance planningOperations researchLogisticsService managementSoftware as a serviceVisitor management systemsReferences[edit]^Almajali, Dmaithan (2016).

Elm is purely functional, and is developed with emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness. It advertises ""no runtimeexceptions in practice"",[6] made possible by the Elm compiler's static type checking.

History[edit]Elm was initially designed by Evan Czaplicki as his thesis in 2012.[7] The first release of Elm came with many examples and an online editor that made it easy to try out in a web browser.[8] Evan joined Prezi in 2013 to work on Elm,[9] and in 2016 moved to NoRedInk as an Open Source Engineer, also starting the Elm Software Foundation.[10]The initial implementation of the Elm compiler targets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.[11] The set of core tools has continued to expand, now including a REPL,[12]package manager,[13] time-traveling debugger,[14] and installers for macOS and Windows.[15] Elm also has an ecosystem of community created libraries[16] and an advanced online editor that allows saved work and inclusion of community libraries.[17]Features[edit]Elm has a small set of language constructs, including traditional if-expressions, let-expressions for local state, and case-expressions for pattern matching.[18] As a functional language, it supports anonymous functions, functions as arguments, and partial application by default. Its semantics include immutable values, stateless functions, and static typing with type inference. Elm programs render HTML through a virtual DOM, and may interoperate with other code by using ""JavaScript as a service"".
Immutability[edit]All values in Elm are immutable, meaning that a value cannot be modified after it is created. Elm uses persistent data structures to implement its Array, Dict, and Set libraries.[19]Static types[edit]Elm is statically typed. Type annotations are optional (due to type inference) but strongly encouraged. Annotations exist on the line above the definition (unlike C-family languages where types and names are interspersed). Elm uses a single colon to mean ""has type"".
Types include primitives like integers and strings, and basic data structures such as lists, tuples, and records. Functions have types written with arrows, for example round : Float -> Int. Custom types allow the programmer to create custom types to represent data in a way that matches the problem domain.[20]Types can refer to other types, for example a List Int. Types are always capitalized; lowercase names are type variables. For example, a List a is a list of values of unknown type. It is the type of the empty list and of the argument to List.length, which is agnostic to the list's elements. There are a few special types that programmers create to interact with the Elm runtime. For example, Html Msg represents a (virtual) DOM tree whose event handlers all produce messages of type Msg.
Rather than allow any value to be implicitly nullable (such a JavaScript's undefined or a null pointer), Elm's standard library defines a Maybe a type. Code that produces or handles an optional value does so explicitly using this type, and all other code is guaranteed a value of the claimed type is actually present.
Elm provides a limited number of built-in type classes: number which includes Int and Float to facilitate the use of numeric operators such as (+) or (*), comparable which includes numbers, characters, strings, lists of comparable things, and tuples of comparable things to facilitate the use of comparison operators, and appendable which includes strings and lists to facilitate concatenation with (++). Elm does not provide a mechanism to include custom types into these type classes or create new type classes (see Limitations section).
Module system[edit]Elm has a module system that allows users to break their code into smaller parts called modules. Modules can hide implementation details such as helper functions, and group related code together. Modules serve as a namespace for imported code, such as Bitwise.and. Third party libraries (or packages) consist of one or more modules, and are available from the Elm Public Library. All libraries are versioned according to semver, which is enforced by the compiler and other tools. That is, removing a function or changing its type can only be done in a major release.
Interoperability with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript[edit]Elm uses an abstraction called ports to communicate with JavaScript.[21] It allows values to flow in and out of Elm programs, making it possible to communicate between Elm and JavaScript.
Elm has a library called elm/html that a programmer can use to write HTML and CSS within Elm.[22] It uses a virtual DOM approach to make updates efficient.[23]Backend[edit]Elm does not officially support server-side development. The core development team does not consider it as their primary goal and prefers to focus development on the enhancement of front-end development experience.  Nevertheless, there are several independent projects, which attempt to explore possibilities to use Elm for the back-end. The projects are mainly stuck on Elm version 0.18.0 since newer ones do not support ""native"" code and some other utilized features. There are two attempts to use Elm with BEAM (Erlang virtual machine). One of the projects executes Elm directly on the environment[24] while another one compiles it to Elixir.[25] Also, there was an attempt to create a back-end framework for Elm powered by Node.js infrastructure.[26] None of the projects are production-ready.
The Elm Architecture[edit]The Elm Architecture is a pattern for building interactive web applications. Elm applications are naturally constructed in that way, but other projects may find the concept useful.
An Elm program is always split into three parts:
Model - the state of the applicationView - a function that turns the model into HTMLUpdate - a function that updates the model based on messagesThose are the core of the Elm Architecture. 
For example, imagine an application that displays a number and a button that increments the number when pressed.[27] In this case, all we need to store is one number, so our model can be as simple as  type alias Model = Int.  The view function would be defined with the Html library and display the number and button. For the number to be updated, we need to be able to send a message to the update function, which is done through a custom type such as type Msg = Increase. The  Increase value is attached it to the button defined in the view function such that when the button is clicked by a user, Increase is passed on to the update function, which can update the model by increasing the number.
In the Elm Architecture, sending messages to  update is the only way to change the state. In more sophisticated applications, messages may come from various sources: user interaction, initialization of the model, internal calls from update, subscriptions to external events (window resize, system clock, JavaScript interop...) and URL changes and requests. 
Limitations[edit]Elm does not support higher-kinded polymorphism,[28] which related languages Haskell and PureScript offer, nor does Elm support the creation of type classes.
This means that, for example, Elm does not have a generic map function which works across multiple data structures such as List and Set. In Elm, such functions are typically invoked qualified by their module name, for example calling List.map and Set.map. In Haskell or PureScript, there would be only one function map. This is a known feature request that is on Czaplicki's rough roadmap since at least 2015.[29]Another outcome is a large amount of boilerplate code in medium to large size projects as illustrated by the author of ""Elm in Action"" in their single page application example[30] with almost identical fragments being repeated in update, view, subscriptions, route parsing and building functions.

These include user account registration and maintenance, menu management, RSS feeds, taxonomy, page layout customization, and system administration. The Drupal core installation can serve as a simple website, a single- or multi-user blog, an Internet forum, or a community website providing for user-generated content.
Drupal also describes itself as a Web application framework.[18] When compared with notable frameworks, Drupal meets most of the generally accepted feature requirements for such web frameworks.[19][20]Although Drupal offers a sophisticated API for developers, basic Web-site installation and administration of the framework require no programming skills.[21]Drupal runs on any computing platform that supports both a web server capable of running PHP and a database to store content and configuration.

Buytaert wanted to call the site ""dorp"" (Dutch for ""village"") for its community aspects, but mistyped it when checking the domain name and thought the error sounded better.[24]Interest in Drupal got a significant boost in 2003 when it helped build ""DeanSpace"" for Howard Dean, one of the candidates in the U.S. Democratic Party's primary campaign for the 2004 U.S. presidential election. DeanSpace used open-source sharing of Drupal to support a decentralized network of approximately 50 disparate, unofficial pro-Dean websites that allowed users to communicate directly with one another as well as with the campaign.[26] After Dean ended his campaign, members of his Web team continued to pursue their interest in developing a Web platform that could aid political activism by launching CivicSpace Labs in July 2004, ""...the first company with full-time employees that was developing and distributing Drupal technology.""[27] Other companies began to also specialize in Drupal development.[28][29] By 2013 the Drupal website listed hundreds of vendors that offered Drupal-related services.[30]As of 2014[update] Drupal is developed by a community.[31] From July 2007 to June 2008 the Drupal.org site provided more than 1.4 million downloads of Drupal software, an increase of approximately 125% from the previous year.[32][33]As of January 2017[update] more than 1,180,000 sites use Drupal.[34] These include hundreds of well-known organizations,[35] including corporations, media and publishing companies, governments, non-profits,[36] schools, and individuals. Drupal has won several Packt Open Source CMS Awards[37] and won the Webware 100[clarification needed] three times in a row.[38][39]Drupal 6 was released on February 13, 2008,[40] on March 5, 2009 Buytaert announced a code freeze for Drupal 7 for September 1, 2009.[41] Drupal 7 was released on January 5, 2011, with release parties in several countries.[42] After that, maintenance on Drupal 5 stopped, with only Drupal 7 and Drupal 6 maintained.[43] Drupal 7 series maintenance updates are released regularly.[44] Previously, Drupal 7's end-of-life was scheduled for November 2021, but given the impact of COVID-19, the end of life has been pushed back until November 28, 2022.  Drupal 8 will still be end-of-life on November 2, 2021.  [45]On October 7, 2015 Drupal 8 first release candidate (rc1) was announced.[46] Drupal 8 includes new features and improvements for both users and developers, including: a revamped user interface; WYSIWYG and in-place editing; improved mobile support; added and improved key contributed modules including Views, Date, and Entity Reference; introduced a new object-oriented backend leveraging Symfony components; revamped configuration management; and improved multilingual support. Drupal 8 rc1 is the collective work of over 3,200 core contributors.[47]Drupal 8.0.0 was released on November 19, 2015.[48] Subsequent major and minor releases which bring numerous improvements and bug fixes (including CKEditor WYSIWYG enhancements, added APIs, an improved help page) can be found on the Releases page.[49]Drupal 9 initial release 9.0.0 was on June 3, 2020.[50]Drupal 10's initial release schedule is on July 2022.[51]Core[edit]In the Drupal community, ""core"" refers to the collaboratively built codebase that can be extended through contributory modules and – for versions prior to Drupal 8 – is kept outside of the ""sites"" folder of a Drupal installation.[52] (Starting with version 8, core is kept in its own 'core' sub-directory.) Drupal core is the stock element of Drupal. Common Drupal-specific libraries, as well as the bootstrap process, are defined as Drupal core; all other functionality is defined as Drupal modules including the system module itself.
In a Drupal website's default configuration, authors can contribute content as either registered or anonymous users (at the discretion of the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of selectable criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some Symfony libraries into Drupal core.
Core modules also includes a hierarchical taxonomy system, which lets developers categorize content or tagged with key words for easier access.[21]Drupal maintains a detailed changelog of core feature updates by version.[53]Core modules[edit]Drupal core includes optional modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website.[54]The core Drupal distribution provides a number of features, including:[54].mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}Access statistics and loggingAdvanced searchBlogs, books, comments, forums, and pollsCaching and feature throttling for improved performanceDescriptive URLsMulti-level menu systemMulti-site support[55]Multi-user content creation and editingOpenID supportRSS feed and feed aggregatorSecurity and new release update notificationUser profilesVarious access control restrictions (user roles, IP addresses, email)Workflow tools (triggers and actions)Core themes[edit]Drupal includes core themes, which customize the ""look and feel"" of Drupal sites,[56] for example, Garland and Bartik.
The Color Module, introduced in Drupal core 5.0, allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface.[57]Localization[edit]As of January 2017[update], Drupal had been made available in 100 languages and English (the default).[58] Support is included for right-to-left languages such as Arabic, Persian, and Hebrew.[59]Drupal localization is built on top of gettext, the GNU internationalization and localization (i18n) library.
Auto-update notification[edit]Drupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules, themes, or the Drupal core.[59] It's important to update quickly after security updates are released.
Before updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core, modules, theme, files and database. If there is any error shown after update or if the new update is not compatible with a module, then it can be quickly replaced by backup. There are several backup modules available in Drupal.
On October 15, 2014, a sql injection vulnerability was announced and update released.[60] Two weeks later the Drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within 7 hours of the announcement are infected.[61] Thus, it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool to make this process easier like drush is highly recommended.
Database abstraction[edit]Prior to version 7, Drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases, such as SQL query cleansing, multi-site table name prefixing, and generating proper SQL queries. In particular, Drupal 6 introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create SQL queries without writing SQL.
Drupal 9 extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses PHP Data Objects to abstract the database. Microsoft has written a database driver for their SQL Server. Drupal 7 supports the file-based SQLite database engine, which is part of the standard PHP distribution.
Windows development[edit]With Drupal 9's new database abstraction layer, and ability to run on the Windows web server IIS, it is now easier for Windows developers to participate in the Drupal community.
A group on Drupal.org is dedicated to Windows issues.[62]Accessibility[edit]Since the release of Drupal 7, Web accessibility has been constantly improving in the Drupal community.[63] Drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities, because many of the best practices have been incorporated into Drupal Core. 
Drupal 8 saw many improvements from the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 guidelines which support both an accessible authoring environment as well as support for authors to produce more accessible content. 
The accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community.
Drupal 8 has good semantic support for Rich Internet Applications through WAI-ARIA. There have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of Drupal, especially:
Drag and drop functionality;Improved color contrast and intensity;Adding skip navigation to core themes;Adding labels by default for input forms;Fixing CSS display:none with consistent methods for hiding and exposing text on focus;Adding support for ARIA Live Regions with Drupal.announce(); andAdding a TabbingManager to support better keyboard navigation.[64]The community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in Drupal 8.[65]Extending the core[edit]Drupal core is modular, defining a system of hooks and callbacks, which are accessed internally via an API.[66] This design allows third-party contributed modules and themes to extend or override Drupal's default behaviors without changing Drupal core's code.
Drupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes. This increases flexibility and security and allows administrators to cleanly upgrade to new releases without overwriting their site's customizations.[67] The Drupal community has the saying, ""Never hack core,"" a strong recommendation that site developers do not change core files.[52]Modules[edit]Contributed modules offer such additional or alternate features as image galleries, custom content types and content listings, WYSIWYG editors, private messaging, third-party integration tools,[68] integrating with BPM portals,[69] and more. As of December 2019[update] the Drupal website lists more than 44,000 free modules.[15]Some of the most commonly used contributed modules include:[70]Content Construction Kit (CCK): allows site administrators to dynamically create content types by extending the database schema. ""Content type"" describes the kind of information. Content types include, but are not limited to, events, invitations, reviews, articles, and products. The CCK Fields API is in Drupal core in Drupal 7.[71][72]Views: facilitates the retrieval and presentation, through a database abstraction system, of content to site visitors. Basic views functionality has been added to core in Drupal 8.[73]Panels: drag and drop layout manager that allows site administrators to visually design their site.Rules: conditionally executed actions based on recurring events.Features: enables the capture and management of features (entities, views, fields, configuration, etc.) into custom modules.Context: allows definition of sections of site where Drupal features can be conditionally activatedMedia: makes photo uploading and media management easierServices: provides an API for Drupal.Organic Groups Mailing ListThemes[edit]As of December 2019[update], there are more than 2,800 free community-contributed themes.[16] Themes adapt or replace a Drupal site's default look and feel.
Drupal themes use standardized formats that may be generated by common third-party theme design engines. Many are written in the PHPTemplate engine[74] or, to a lesser extent, the XTemplate engine.[75] Some templates use hard-coded PHP. Drupal 8 and future versions of Drupal integrate the Twig templating engine.
The inclusion of the PHPTemplate and XTemplate engines in Drupal addressed user concerns about flexibility and complexity.[76] The Drupal theming system utilizes a template engine to further separate HTML/CSS from PHP. A popular Drupal contributed module called 'Devel' provides GUI information to developers and themers about the page build.
Community-contributed themes at the Drupal website are released under a free GPL license.[77][78]Distributions[edit]In the past, those wanting a fully customized installation of Drupal had to download a pre-tailored version separately from the official Drupal core. Today, however, a distribution defines a packaged version of Drupal that upon installation, provides a website or application built for a specific purpose.
The distributions offer the benefit of a new Drupal site without having to manually seek out and install third-party contributed modules or adjust configuration settings.[79] They are collections of modules, themes, and associated configuration settings that prepare Drupal for custom operation. For example, a distribution could configure Drupal as a ""brochure"" site rather than a news site or online store.
Architecture[edit]Drupal is based on the Presentation Abstraction Control architecture, or PAC.
The menu system acts as the Controller. It accepts input via a single source (HTTP GET and POST), routes requests to the appropriate helper functions, pulls data out of the Abstraction (nodes and, from Drupal 5 onwards, forms), and then pushes it through a filter to get a Presentation of it (the theme system).
It even has multiple, parallel PAC agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas (page.tpl.php).[80]Community[edit]Drupal.org has a large community of users and developers who provide active community support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of Drupal.[81] As of January 2017[update] more than 105,400 users are actively contributing.[14] The semiannual DrupalCon conference alternates between North America, Europe and Asia.[82] Attendance at DrupalCon grew from 500 at Szeged in August 2008, to over 3,700 people at Austin, Texas in June, 2014.
Smaller events, known as ""Drupal Camps"" or DrupalCamp, occur throughout the year all over the world.[83] The annual Florida DrupalCamp brings users together for Coding for a Cause that benefits a local nonprofit organization, as does the annual GLADCamp (Greater Los Angeles Drupal Camp) event, Coders with a Cause.
The Drupal community also organizes professional and semi-professional gatherings called meetups at a large number of venues around the world. 
There are a number of active Drupal forums, mailing lists and discussion groups.[84][85][86] Drupal also maintains several IRC channels on the Freenode network.[87]There are over 30 national communities[88] around drupal.org offering language-specific support.
Notable Drupal users include NBC, Taboola, Patch, and We the People.[89]Security[edit]Drupal's policy is to announce the nature of each security vulnerability once the fix is released.[90][91]Administrators of Drupal sites are automatically notified of these new releases via the Update Status module (Drupal 6) or via the Update Manager (Drupal 7).[92]Drupal maintains a security announcement mailing list, a history of all security advisories, a security team home page, and an RSS feed with the most recent security advisories.[93][94][95]In mid-October 2014, Drupal issued a ""highly critical"" security advisory regarding an SQL injection bug in Drupal 7, also known as Drupalgeddon.[96][97][98]Downloading and installing an upgrade to Drupal 7.32 fixes the vulnerability, but does not remove any backdoor installed by hackers if the site has already been compromised.[99] Attacks began soon after the vulnerability was announced. According to the Drupal security team, where a site was not patched within hours of the announcement, it should be considered compromised and taken offline by being replaced with a static HTML page while the administrator of its server must be told that other sites on the same server may also have been compromised.
To solve the problem, the site must be restored using backups from before October 15, be patched and manually updated, and anything merged from the site must be audited.[100]In late March 2018, a patch for vulnerability CVE-2018-7600, also dubbed Drupalgeddon2, was released. The underlying bug allows remote attackers without special roles or permissions to take complete control of Drupal 6, 7, and 8 sites.[101][102] Starting early April, large scale automated attacks against vulnerable sites were observed, and on April 20, a high level of penetration of unpatched sites was reported.[103]On 23 December 2019, Drupal patched an arbitrary file upload flaw. The file-upload flaw affects Drupal 8.8.x before 8.8.1 and 8.7.x before 8.7.11, and the vulnerability is listed as moderately critical by Drupal.[104][105]Drupal 6 Long Term Support[edit]While Drupal 6 is no longer supported as of 24th Feb 2016, there are two approved Long Term Services Vendors.[106]Drupal 7 Extended Support[edit]Just like Drupal 6 Long Term Support, Drupal 7 will have its own after its official end-of-life 28th November 2022.[107][108]Drupal certifications[edit]Drupal certifications managed by Acquia is available whether you're an experienced Drupal developer or a Drupal site content editor. As of Jul 2020, you can choose from either Drupal 7, 8 or 9.[109]See also[edit].mw-parser-output .portal{border:solid #aaa 1px;padding:0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tleft{margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tright{margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul{display:table;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0.1em;max-width:175px;background:#f9f9f9;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li{display:table-row}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:first-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:last-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle}Free and open-source software portalComparison of web frameworksList of applications with iCalendar supportList of content management systemsReferences[edit]^""CHANGELOG.txt"".

You should proceed under the assumption that every Drupal 7 website was compromised unless updated or patched before Oct 15th, 11pm UTC, that is 7 hours after the announcement.Simply updating to Drupal 7.32 will not remove backdoors....updating to version 7.32 or applying the patch fixes the vulnerability but does not fix an already compromised website. If you find that your site is already patched but you didn’t do it, that can be a symptom that the site was compromised - some attacks have applied the patch as a way to guarantee they are the only attacker in control of the site.^Robinson, Brian (2014-11-07).

Career[edit]Buytaert was born in Wilrijk, Antwerp, Belgium.[1]Buytaert defended his PhD dissertation in computer science on 27 January 2008,[4] at Ghent University in Belgium.[5]From 1999 to 2000 he was the maintainer of the Linux-WLAN FAQ.[6]On 1 December 2007, Dries announced,[7] together with co-founder Jay Batson the launch of a start-up called Acquia.[8] Acquia is a commercial open-source software company providing products, services, and technical support for Drupal. Acquia tries to be to Drupal what Red Hat has been to Linux.[9] In 2009, Acquia helped re-launch Whitehouse.gov on Drupal.[10] Dries serves as CTO of Acquia.[11]On 31 March 2008, Dries launched Mollom, a service dedicated to stopping website spam: ""Mollom's purpose is to dramatically reduce the effort of keeping your site clean and the quality of your content high. Currently, Mollom is a spam-killing one-two punch combination of a state-of-the-art spam filter and CAPTCHA server."" Over 59,000 websites are protected by the Mollom service,[12] including all of Netlog's messages.[13] Mollom support ended 2 April 2018.[14]In 2008, Buytaert was elected ""Young Entrepreneurs of Tech"" by BusinessWeek.[15] He was also named to the MITTechnology ReviewTR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[16][17]References[edit]^ abCurriculum VitaeArchived 21 August 2010 at the Wayback Machine^""History"".

F# is most often used as a cross-platform Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) language on .NET Core, but it can also generate JavaScript[9] and graphics processing unit (GPU) code.[10]F# is developed by the F# Software Foundation,[11]Microsoft and open contributors. An open source, cross-platform compiler for F# is available from the F# Software Foundation.[12] F# is a fully supported language in Visual Studio[13] and JetBrains Rider.[14]Plug-ins supporting F# exist for many widely used editors, most notably the Ionide extension for Visual Studio Code, and integrations for other editors such as Vim, and Emacs.
F# is a member of the ML language family and originated as a .NET Framework implementation of a core of the programming language OCaml.[6][7] It has also been influenced by C#, 
Python, Haskell,[5]Scala, and Erlang.

Language evolution[edit]F# uses an open development and engineering process. 
The language evolution process is managed by Don Syme from Microsoft Research as the benevolent dictator for life (BDFL) for the language design, together with the F# Software Foundation.
Earlier versions of the F# language were designed by Microsoft and Microsoft Research using a closed development process.
F# originates from Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK. The language was originally designed and implemented by Don Syme,[6] according to whom in the fsharp team, they say the F is for ""Fun"".[24] 
Andrew Kennedy contributed to the design of units of measure.[6] The Visual F# Tools for Visual Studio are developed by Microsoft.[6] The F# Software Foundation developed the F# open-source compiler and tools, incorporating the open-source compiler implementation provided by the Microsoft Visual F# Tools team.[11]Summary of versions

The programmer does not need to declare types—the compiler deduces types during compilation (type inference). F# also allows explicit type annotations, and requires them in some situations.
F# is an expression-based language using eager evaluation and also in some instances lazy evaluation. Every statement in F#, 
including if expressions, try expressions and loops, is a composable expression with a static type.[30] Functions and expressions that do not return any value have a return type of unit. F# uses the let keyword for binding values to a name.[30] For example:
letx=3+4binds the value 7 to the name x.
New types are defined using the type keyword. For functional programming, F# provides tuple, record, discriminated union, list, option, and result types.[30] A tuple represents a set of n values, where n ≥ 0. The value n is called the arity of the tuple. A 3-tuple would be represented as (A, B, C), where A, B, and C are values of possibly different types. A tuple can be used to store values only when the number of values is known at design-time and stays constant during execution.
A record is a type where the data members are named. Here is an example of record definition: 
typeR= 
        {Name:string 
         Age:int}Records can be created as letr={Name=""AB"";Age=42}. The with keyword is used to create a copy of a record, as in {rwithName=""CD""}, which creates a new record by copying r and changing the value of the Name field (assuming the record created in the last example was named r).
A discriminated union type is a type-safe version of C unions. For example,
typeA= 
    |UnionCaseXofstring
    |UnionCaseYofintValues of the union type can correspond to either union case. The types of the values carried by each union case is included in the definition of each case.
The list type is an immutable linked list represented either using a head::tail notation (:: is the cons operator) or a shorthand as [item1;item2;item3]. An empty list is written []. The option type is a discriminated union type with choices Some(x) or None. F# types may be generic, implemented as generic .NET types.
F# supports lambda functions and closures.[30] All functions in F# are first class values and are immutable.[30] Functions can be curried. Being first-class values, functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.  Like other functional programming languages, F# allows function composition using the >> and << operators.
F# provides sequence expressions[31] that define a sequence seq { ... }, list [ ... ] or array [| ... |] through code that generates values. For example,
seq{forbin0..25do
           ifb<15then
               yieldb*b}forms a sequence of squares of numbers from 0 to 14 by filtering out numbers from the range of numbers from 0 to 25. Sequences are generators – values are generated on-demand (i.e., are lazily evaluated) – while lists and arrays are evaluated eagerly.
F# uses pattern matching to bind values to names. Pattern matching is also used when accessing discriminated unions – the union is value matched against pattern rules and a rule is selected when a match succeeds. F# also supports Active Patterns as a form of extensible pattern matching.[32] It is used, for example, when multiple ways of matching on a type exist.[30]F# supports a general syntax for defining compositional computations called computation expressions. Sequence expressions, asynchronous computations and queries are particular kinds of computation expressions. Computation expressions are an implementation of the monad pattern.[31]Imperative programming[edit]F# support for imperative programming includes
forloopswhileloopsarrays, created with the [| ... |] syntaxhash table, created with the dict [ ... ] syntax or System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<_,_> type.Values and record fields can also be labelled as mutable. For example:
// Define 'x' with initial value '1'letmutablex=1// Change the value of 'x' to '3'x<-3Also, F# supports access to all CLI types and objects such as those defined in the System.Collections.Generic namespace defining imperative data structures.
Object-oriented programming[edit]Like other Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) languages, F# can use CLI types through object-oriented programming.[30]  F# support for object-oriented programming in expressions includes:
Dot-notation, e.g., x.NameObject expressions, e.g., {newobj()withmemberx.ToString()=""hello""}Object construction, e.g., newForm()Type tests, e.g., x:?stringType coercions, e.g., x:?>stringNamed arguments, e.g., x.Method(someArgument=1)Named setters, e.g., newForm(Text=""Hello"")Optional arguments, e.g., x.Method(OptionalArgument=1)Support for object-oriented programming in patterns includes
Type tests, e.g., :?stringassActive patterns, which can be defined over object types[32]F# object type definitions can be class, struct, interface, enum, or delegate type definitions, corresponding to the definition forms found in C#. For example, here is a class with a constructor taking a name and age, and declaring  two properties.
/// A simple object type definitiontypePerson(name:string,age:int)=
    memberx.Name=name
    memberx.Age=ageAsynchronous programming[edit]F# supports asynchronous programming through asynchronous workflows.[33] An asynchronous workflow is defined as a sequence of commands inside an async{ ... }, as in
letasynctask= 
    async{letreq=WebRequest.Create(url)
            let!response=req.GetResponseAsync()
            usestream=response.GetResponseStream()
            usestreamreader=newSystem.IO.StreamReader(stream)
            returnstreamreader.ReadToEnd()}The let! indicates that the expression on the right (getting the response) should be done asynchronously but the flow should only continue when the result is available. In other words, from the point of view of the code block, it's as if getting the response is a blocking call, whereas from the point of view of the system, the thread won't be blocked and may be used to process other flows while the result needed for this one doesn't become available.
The async block may be invoked using the Async.RunSynchronously function. Multiple async blocks can be executed in parallel using the Async.Parallel function that takes a list of async objects (in the example, asynctask is an async object) and creates another async object to run the tasks in the lists in parallel. The resultant object is invoked using Async.RunSynchronously.[33]Inversion of control in F# follows this pattern.[33]Parallel programming[edit]Parallel programming is supported partly through the Async.Parallel, Async.Start and other operations that run asynchronous blocks in parallel.
Parallel programming is also supported through the Array.Parallel functional programming operators in the F# standard library, direct use of the System.Threading.Tasks task programming model, the direct use of .NET thread pool and .NET threads and through dynamic translation of F# code to alternative parallel execution engines such as GPU[10] code.
Units of measure[edit]The F# type system supports units of measure checking for numbers.[34] The units of measure feature integrates with F# type inference to require minimal type annotations in user code.[35]Metaprogramming[edit]F# allows some forms of syntax customizing via metaprogramming to support embedding custom domain-specific languages within the F# language, particularly through computation expressions.[30]F# includes a feature for run-time meta-programming called quotations.[36] A quotation expression evaluates to an abstract syntax tree representation of the F# expressions. Similarly, definitions labelled with the [<ReflectedDefinition>] attribute can also be accessed in their quotation form. F# quotations are used for various purposes including to compile F# code into JavaScript[9] and GPU[10] code. (Quotations represent their F# code expressions as data for use by other parts of the program while requiring it to be syntactically correct F# code).
Information-rich programming[edit]F# 3.0 introduced a form of compile-time meta-programming through statically extensible type generation called F# type providers.[37] F# type providers allow the F# compiler and tools to be extended with components that provide type information to the compiler on-demand at compile time. F# type providers have been used to give strongly typed access to connected information sources in a scalable way, including to the Freebase knowledge graph.[38]In F# 3.0 the F# quotation and computation expression features are combined to implement LINQ queries.[39]  For example:
// Use the OData type provider to create types that can be used to access the Northwind database.openMicrosoft.FSharp.Data.TypeProviders

typeNorthwind=ODataService<""http://services.odata.org/Northwind/Northwind.svc"">letdb=Northwind.GetDataContext()

// A query expression.letquery1=query{forcustomerindb.Customersdo
                     selectcustomer}The combination of type providers, queries and strongly typed functional programming is known as information rich programming.[40]Agent programming[edit]F# supports a variation of the  Actor programming model through the in-memory implementation of lightweight asynchronous agents. For example, the following code defines an agent and posts 2 messages:
letcounter=
    MailboxProcessor.Start(funinbox->
        letrecloopn=
            async{doprintfn""n = %d, waiting...""n
                    let!msg=inbox.Receive()
                    return!loop(n+msg)}
        loop0)Development tools[edit]Visual Studio, with the Visual F# tools from Microsoft installed, can be used to create, run and debug F# projects. The Visual F# tools include a Visual Studio-hosted read–eval–print loop (REPL) interactive console that can execute F# code as it is written.  Visual Studio for Mac also fully supports F# projects.Visual Studio Code contains full support for F# via the Ionide extension.F# can be developed with any text editor. Specific support exists in editors such as Emacs.JetBrains Rider is optimized for the development of F# Code starting with release 2019.1.[41]LINQPad has supported F# since version 2.x.Application areas[edit]F# is a general-purpose programming language.
Web programming[edit]The SAFE Stack is an end-to-end F# stack to develop web applications. It uses ASP.NET Core on the server side and Fable on the client side.[42]An alternative end-to-end F# option is the WebSharper framework.[43]Cross-platform app development[edit]F# can be used together with the Visual Studio Tools for Xamarin to develop apps for iOS and Android. The Fabulous library provides a more comfortable functional interface.
Analytical programming[edit]Among others, F# is used for quantitative finance programming,[44] energy trading and portfolio optimization,[45] machine learning,[46] business intelligence[47] and social gaming on Facebook.[48]In the 2010s, F# has been positioned as an optimized alternative to C#. F#'s scripting ability and inter-language compatibility with all Microsoft products have made it popular among developers. Many developers are creating systems based on F# and use C# WCF Services.[clarification needed][citation needed][who?]Scripting[edit]F# can be used as a scripting language, mainly for desktop read–eval–print loop (REPL) scripting.[49]Open-source community[edit]The F# open-source community includes the F# Software Foundation[11] and the F# Open Source Group at GitHub.[12] Popular open-source F# projects include:
Fable, an F# to Javascript transpiler based on Babel.Paket, an alternative package manager for .NET that can still use NuGet repositories, but has centralised version-management.FAKE, an F# friendly build-system.Giraffe, a functionally oriented middleware for ASP.NET Core.Suave, a lightweight web-server and web-development library.Compatibility[edit]F# features a legacy ""ML compatibility mode"" that can directly compile programs written in a large subset of OCaml roughly, with no functors, objects, polymorphic variants, or other additions.

I think it makes less sense now to redirect this page to Clojure. I disagree with the original decision to delete this article. If the same logic that was applied here holds, I would expect Martin Odersky's article to be deleted as well.
I did a roundup of additional sources:

Objection to Deletion[edit]The article as it exists includes the following link: http://www.simple-talk.com/opinion/geek-of-the-week/rich-hickey-geek-of-the-week/ which in my opinion should support a refutation of WP:N concerns.  It would have been better if the editor who proposed deletion had reviewed the links already present on the page before proposing deletion.  It's true that the article can be edited to provide more information as in-line references, and a simple Google shows much more content about Mr. Hickey that could be linked, and an even greater corpus of WP:N content about his creation, Clojure.
At a minimum, discussion on this page about edits to improve the article would seem to have been appropriate. Jonabbey (talk) 19:12, 6 September 2010 (UTC)
As it stands, the article does not appear to me to reflect the ""reliable source"" support reflected in references that would warrant it surviving an AfD review.  The lone Simple-Talk article would not be considered sufficient.  First, it does not appear to be an RS.  Second, it is just one article; far less than what is required to reflect notability.--Epeefleche (talk) 03:22, 11 September 2010 (UTC)

本页面最后修订于2020年11月7日 (星期六) 13:14。,"终身仁慈独裁者（英語：Benevolent Dictator For Life，缩写BDFL）是少数开源软件开发者所拥有的头衔。他们通常是某一项目的创始人，并在该项目社区出现争议时拥有最终的决定权。
这一称号诞生于1995年，最初用来指Python语言的创始人吉多·范罗苏姆。[1][2]当时在范罗苏姆刚加入全国研究创新联合会（英语：Corporation for National Research Initiatives）后，肯马·内梅尔（英语：Ken Manheimer）在一封邮件中试图创立一个监管Python语言开发的半正式团体。他在该邮件中首次使用了BDFL这一称呼，并戏称范罗苏姆为“首任临时BDFL”。[1]2018年7月12日，范罗苏姆宣布不再出任Python语言的BDFL。[3]值得一提的是，BDFL与另一个用来指开源运动领导人的称呼“仁慈的独裁者”（benevolent dictator）的含义并不一致。后者因埃里克·雷蒙的《开拓智域》（Homesteading the Noosphere）一文而广为人知。雷蒙在文中提到，开源软件运动的本质会促使“独裁者”保持仁慈，否则巨大的分歧会导致项目被复刻并由新的领导所掌管。[4]被称为BDFL的人物列表[编辑]

   / 18 January 2019; 23 months ago (2019-01-18)[1]Written inPerlTypeWeb application frameworkLicensePAL and GPLWebsitewww.catalystframework.orgCatalyst is an open sourceweb application framework written in Perl, that closely follows the model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, and supports a number of experimental web patterns. It is written using Moose, a modern object system for Perl. Its design is heavily inspired by such frameworks as Ruby on Rails, Maypole, and Spring.
A web application developer would use Catalyst to deal with code common to all web applications: it provides interfaces to web servers and receiving page requests, dispatching these into developer-written code to process and return the requests, and provides a standardised interface for data models, authentication, session management and other common web application elements.
All of these elements are implemented as plugins to a set of common interfaces, allowing the developer to change the specific method used (e.g. a session storing in shared memory versus as a database table, or using FastCGI versus operating as an within Apache's mod_perl) by changing the configuration of Catalyst to use a different plugin without altering the application code.
Catalyst is primarily distributed through the CPAN, which is the official distribution channel for Perl libraries and applications.

History[edit]Maypole was one of the first web application frameworks for the Perl programming language that was based on the MVC pattern; its principal author was Simon Cozens.[2] Catalyst started as a fork of Maypole, intended to become Maypole 3.0.[3] Development ceased on Maypole, however, with its most recent release in April 2008,[4] and Catalyst became its modern supported equivalent.
The first development release of Catalyst took place on 28 January 2005. The first official version was placed in CPAN on 16 February 2005.[5] As of June 2011, Catalyst had 201 registered contributors.[6]Philosophy[edit]Catalyst is based on a ""don't repeat yourself"" (DRY) principle, which means that definitions should only have to be made once. Catalyst can be used with automatic class loading from the database through one of the many loader modules, thus requiring no code for the database layer. But, if you require the flexibility of manually doing everything, it's also an option. Another guiding principle of Catalyst is flexibility.
Catalyst promotes the re-use of existing Perl modules that already handle common web application concerns well.
The Model part is handled through DBIx::Class, Plucene, Net::LDAP and other model classes.The View layer is usually handled by Template Toolkit, Mason, or HTML::Template, among others.The Controller layer is of course written by each application author. Large chunks of Controller functionality can usually be deferred to one of the many Catalyst plugins (e.g., Catalyst::Plugin::FormValidator, Catalyst::Plugin::Prototype, Catalyst::Plugin::Account::AutoDiscovery, etc.).Finally, Catalyst offers a set of helpers to simplify flow control and mapping URLs to controller methods.Catalyst has a large selection of plugins.[7] For example, it has JavaScript generation for Ajax and RIAs using the Catalyst::Plugin::Prototype module (prototype is an Ajax framework). Plugins cover many areas, for example authentication, session management, HTTP negotiation and REST.
Catalyst can also be used with other Ajax frameworks such as jQuery or YUI, the Yahoo! User Interface Library.
Web server support[edit]For development and testing, Catalyst has a built-in simple HTTP server. For production use, Apache, lighttpd, Hiawatha, Cherokee or Nginx with FastCGI or mod_perl support is recommended, but any web server with CGI or FastCGI support will work. On Apache, mod_perl can help with performance considerably, though its use might be an issue because it can be unsafe to share multiple applications under mod_perl.
Since early 2008, Catalyst applications can also be deployed using the HTTP::Prefork engine[8] which provides for the deployment of high performance Catalyst applications without a separate web server. Starting with the release of Catalyst 5.9, Catalyst also outputs to the PSGI spec thus it can be run on any Plack server and along with any server or protocol that supports the PSGI spec, including Mongrel2.
Database support[edit]Catalyst can run using any database supported by Perl's DBI (this means almost anything, even a CSV file), but a proper RDBMS or ODBMS is recommended. The database access is entirely abstracted from the programmer's point of view and Catalyst, through one of its model classes, handles access to all databases automatically – though, if needed, using direct SQL queries is possible. This enables database-neutrality, application portability over different database systems, and usability of pre-existing databases for Catalyst application development as much as possible, though due to different feature sets of the RDBMSes, it is not completely guaranteed by the framework alone. Several different RDBMS systems are supported, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, IBM DB2, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. For ODBMSes, there is explicit support for KiokuDB via Catalyst::Model::KiokuDB.[9] The Model abstraction allows databases of any nature to be accessed via Catalyst::Model::Adaptor.[10]Many Catalyst-based projects use DBIx::Class as the ORM layer, which provides further abstraction of SQL queries, using a resultset-based API with transparent support for arbitrary joins and other features.

"6 October 2020, at 12:30","A code generation technique or a project generation techniqueScaffolding, as used in computing, refers to one of two techniques: The first is a code generation technique related to database access in some model–view–controllerframeworks; the second is a project generation technique supported by various tools.
Contents1Code generation1.1Run-time vs. design-time scaffolding1.2Scaffolding in Ruby on Rails1.3Server side vs Client side Scaffolding2Project generation3See also4External links

Code generation[edit]Scaffolding is a technique supported by some model–view–controllerframeworks, in which the programmer can specify how the application database may be used. The compiler or framework uses this specification, together with pre-defined code templates, to generate the final code that the application can use to create, read, update and delete database entries, effectively treating the templates as a ""scaffold"" on which to build a more powerful application.
Scaffolding is an evolution of database code generators from earlier development environments, such as Oracle's CASE Generator, and many other 4GL client-server software development products.
Scaffolding was made popular by the Ruby on Rails framework. It has been adapted to other software frameworks, including OutSystems Platform, Express Framework, Play framework, Django, web2py, MonoRail, Brail, Symfony, Laravel, CodeIgniter, Yii, CakePHP, Phalcon PHP, Model-Glue, PRADO, Grails, Catalyst, Mojolicious, Seam Framework, Spring Roo, JHipster, ASP.NET Dynamic Data, KumbiaPHP and ASP.NET MVC framework's Metadata Template Helpers.
Run-time vs. design-time scaffolding[edit]Scaffolding can occur at two different phases of the program lifecycle: design time and run time. Design time scaffolding produces files of code that can later be modified by the programmer to customize the way the application database is used. However, for large-scale applications this approach may be difficult to maintain due to the sheer number of files produced, and the fact that the design of the files was largely fixed when they were generated or copied from the original templates.  Alternatively, run time scaffolding produces code on the fly.  It allows changes to the design of the templates to be immediately reflected throughout the application.  But modifying the design of the templates may be more difficult or impractical in the case of run time scaffolding.
Scaffolding in Ruby on Rails[edit]When the line scaffold :model_name is added to a controller, Rails will automatically generate all of the appropriate data interfaces at run time.  Since the API is generated on the fly, the programmer cannot easily modify the interfaces generated this way.  Such a simple scaffold is often used for prototyping applications and entering test data into a database.
The programmer may also run an external command to generate Ruby code for the scaffold in advance: rails generate scaffold model_name.  The generate script will produce files of Ruby code that the application can use to interact with the database.  It is somewhat less convenient than dynamic scaffolding, but gives the programmer the flexibility of modifying and customizing the generated APIs.
Note: As of Rails 2.0, dynamic scaffolding is no longer stored.
Server side vs Client side Scaffolding[edit]Scaffolding techniques based on the application database typically involve Server side frameworks. Server side web frameworks commonly perform operations directly against database entries, and code generation for these operations may be considered Server side Scaffolding. Alternatively, Client side development often uses frameworks that perform data transport operations instead of directly accessing the database. The focus of Client side Scaffolding is thus more on generating a starter template for the application as a whole, rather than generating code to access a database.
Some Client side web frameworks, such as Meteor, allow the client to perform database operations in a manner similar to Server side frameworks. In this case, Scaffolding techniques can go beyond merely generating a starter template. They can perform run time scaffolding of web forms on the Client side to create, read, update and delete database entries. One example of this is provided by an add-on to Meteor called aldeed:autoform [1].
Project generation[edit]Complicated software projects often share certain conventions on project structure and requirements. For example, they often have separate folders for source code, binaries and code tests, as well as files containing license agreements, release notes and contact information. To simplify the creation of projects following those conventions, ""scaffolding"" tools can automatically generate them at the beginning of each project. Such tools include Yeoman, Cargo and Ritchie CLI.

"6 September 2019, at 07:39","Not to be confused with Data migration.In software engineering, schema migration (also database migration, database change management) refers to the management of incremental, reversible changes and version control to relationaldatabase schemas. A schema migration is performed on a database whenever it is necessary to update or revert that database's schema to some newer or older version.
Migrations are performed programmatically by using a schema migration tool. When invoked with a specified desired schema version, the tool automates the successive application or reversal of an appropriate sequence of schema changes until it is brought to the desired state.
Most schema migration tools aim to minimize the impact of schema changes on any existing data in the database. Despite this, preservation of data in general is not guaranteed because schema changes such as the deletion of a database column can destroy data (i.e. all values stored under that column for all rows in that table are deleted). Instead, the tools help to preserve the meaning of the data or to reorganize existing data to meet new requirements. Since meaning of the data often cannot be encoded, the configuration of the tools usually needs manual intervention.

Risks and benefits[edit]Schema migration allows for fixing mistakes and adapting the data as requirements change. They are an essential part of software evolution, especially in agile environments (see below).
Applying a schema migration to a production database is always a risk. Development and test databases tend to be smaller and cleaner. The data in them is better understood or, if everything else fails, the amount of data is small enough for a human to process. Production databases are usually huge, old and full of surprises. The surprises can come from many sources:
Corrupt data that was written by old versions of the software and not cleaned properlyImplied dependencies in the data which no one knows about anymorePeople directly changing the database without using the designated toolsBugs in the schema migration toolsMistakes in assumptions how data should be migratedFor these reasons, the migration process needs a high level of discipline, thorough testing and a sound backup strategy.
Schema migration in agile software development[edit]When developing software applications backed by a database, developers typically develop the application source code in tandem with an evolving database schema. The code typically has rigid expectations of what columns, tables and constraints are present in the database schema whenever it needs to interact with one, so only the version of database schema against which the code was developed is considered fully compatible with that version of source code.
In software testing, while developers may mock the presence of a compatible database system for unit testing, any level of testing higher than this (e.g. integration testing or system testing) it is common for developers to test their application against a local or remote test database schematically compatible with the version of source code under test. In advanced applications, the migration itself can be subject to migration testing.
With schema migration technology, data models no longer need to be fully designed up-front, and are more capable of being adapted with changing project requirements throughout the software development lifecycle.
Relation to revision control systems[edit]Teams of software developers usually use version control systems to manage and collaborate on changes made to versions of source code.
Different developers can develop on divergent, relatively older or newer branches of the same source code to make changes and additions during development.
Supposing that the software under development interacts with a database, every version of the source code can be associated with at least one database schema with which it is compatible.
Under good software testing practice, schema migrations can be performed on test databases to ensure that their schema is compatible to the source code. To streamline this process, a schema migration tool is usually invoked as a part of an automated software build as a prerequisite of the automated testing phase.
Schema migration tools can be said to solve versioning problems for database schemas just as version control systems solve versioning problems for source code. In practice, many schema migration tools actually rely on a textual representation of schema changes (such as files containing SQL statements) such that the version history of schema changes can effectively be stored alongside program source code within VCS. This approach ensures that the information necessary to recover a compatible database schema for a particular code branch is recoverable from the source tree itself. Another benefit of this approach is the handling of concurrent conflicting schema changes; developers may simply use their usual text-based conflict resolution tools to reconcile differences.
Relation to schema evolution[edit]Schema migration tooling could be seen as a facility to track the history of an evolving schema.
Advantages[edit]Developers no longer need to remove the entire test database in order to create a new test database from scratch (e.g. using schema creation scripts from DDL generation tools). Further, if generation of test data costs a lot of time, developers can avoid regenerating test data for small, non-destructive changes to the schema.

Less (SCSS)InfluencedLess, Stylus, Tritium, Bootstrap (v4+)Sass (short for syntactically awesome style sheets) is a preprocessorscripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself.
Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called ""the indented syntax,"" uses a syntax similar to Haml.[2] It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. The newer syntax, ""SCSS"" (Sassy CSS), uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate rules within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively.
CSS3 consists of a series of selectors and pseudo-selectors that group rules that apply to them. Sass (in the larger context of both syntaxes) extends CSS by providing several mechanisms available in more traditional programming languages, particularly object-oriented languages, but that are not available to CSS3 itself. When SassScript is interpreted, it creates blocks of CSS rules for various selectors as defined by the Sass file. The Sass interpreter translates SassScript into CSS. Alternatively, Sass can monitor the .sass or .scss file and translate it to an output .css file whenever the .sass or .scss file is saved.[3]The indented syntax is a metalanguage. SCSS is a nested metalanguage, as valid CSS is valid SCSS with the same semantics.
SassScript provides the following mechanisms: variables, nesting, mixins, and selector inheritance.[2]Contents1History2Major implementations3Features3.1Variables3.2Nesting3.2.1Loops3.2.2Arguments3.2.3In combination3.3Selector inheritance4libSass5IDE integration6See also7References8External links

History[edit]Sass was initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum.[4][5] After its initial versions, Weizenbaum and Chris Eppstein have continued to extend Sass with SassScript, a scripting language used in Sass files.
Major implementations[edit]SassScript was implemented in multiple languages, the noteworthy implementations are:
The original open-sourceRuby implementation created in 2006,[6] since deprecated due to the lack of maintainers and reached End-of-Life in March 2019.[7][8]The official open-source Dart implementation.[6]libSass, the official open-source C++ implementation.the official JavaScript implementation, published as ""sass"" module on npm.JSass, an unofficial Java implementation.[9]phamlp, an unofficial SASS/SCSS implementation in PHP.[6]Vaadin has a Java implementation of Sass.[10]Firebug, a FirefoxXUL (""legacy"") extension for web development.[11] It has been since deprecated in favor of developer tools integrated into Firefox itself. It stopped working since Firefox 57 dropped support for XUL extensions.Features[edit]Variables[edit]Sass allows variables to be defined. Variables begin with a dollar sign ($). Variable assignment is done with a colon (:).[11]SassScript supports four data types:[11]Numbers (including units)Strings (with quotes or without)Colors (name, or names)BooleansVariables can be arguments to or results from one of several available functions.[12] During translation, the values of the variables are inserted into the output CSS document.[2]SCSS

In Sass, inheritance is achieved by inserting a line inside of a code block that uses the @extend keyword and references another selector. The extended selector's attributes are applied to the calling selector.[2]Sass

We wrote our own parser from scratch to make sure that would be possible.""[16]The design goals of libSass are:
Performance – Developers have reported 10x speed up increases over the Ruby implementation of Sass.[17]Easier integration – libSass makes it easier to integrate Sass into more software. Before libSass, tightly integrating Sass into a language or software product required bundling the entire Ruby interpreter. By contrast, libSass is a statically linkable library with zero external dependencies and C-like interface, making it easy to wrap Sass directly into other programming languages and tools. For example, open source libSass bindings now exist for Node, Go, and Ruby.[14]Compatibility – libSass's goal is full compatibility with the official Ruby implementation of Sass. This goal has been achieved on libsass 3.3.[18]IDE integration[edit]IDE integration of Sass

It adds syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby, Python and Haskell in an effort to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability.[4] Specific additional features include list comprehension and destructuring assignment.
CoffeeScript support is included in Ruby on Rails version 3.1[5] and Play Framework.[6] In 2011, Brendan Eich referenced CoffeeScript as an influence on his thoughts about the future of JavaScript.[7][8]Contents1History2Syntax3Development and distribution4Latest additions5Extensions6Adoption7See also8References9Further reading10External links

History[edit]On December 13, 2009, Jeremy Ashkenas made the first Git commit of CoffeeScript with the comment: ""initial commit of the mystery language.""[9] The compiler was written in Ruby. On December 24, he made the first tagged and documented release, 0.1.0. On February 21, 2010, he committed version 0.5, which replaced the Ruby compiler with a self-hosting version in pure CoffeeScript. By that time the project had attracted several other contributors on GitHub, and was receiving over 300 page hits per day.
On December 24, 2010, Ashkenas announced the release of stable 1.0.0 to Hacker News, the site where the project was announced for the first time.[10][11]On September 18, 2017, version 2.0.0 was introduced,[12] which ""aims to bring CoffeeScript into the modern JavaScript era, closing gaps in compatibility with JavaScript while preserving the clean syntax that is CoffeeScript’s hallmark.""
Syntax[edit]Almost everything is an expression in CoffeeScript, for example if, switch and for expressions (which have no return value in JavaScript) return a value. As in Perl, these control statements also have postfix versions; for example, if can also be written in  consequent if condition form.
Many unnecessary parentheses and braces can be omitted; for example, blocks of code can be denoted by indentation instead of braces, function calls are implicit, and object literals are often detected automatically.
To compute the body mass index, one may do (here in JavaScript):
constmass=72constheight=1.78constBMI=mass/height**2if(18.5<BMI&&BMI<25){alert('You are healthy!')}With CoffeeScript the interval is directly described:
mass = 72height = 1.78BMI = mass/height**2alert'You are healthy!'if18.5<BMI<25To compute the greatest common divisor of two integers with the euclidean algorithm, in JavaScript one usually needs a while loop:
gcd=(x,y)=>{
  do{
    z=x%y
    x=y
    y=z
  }while(y!==0)
  returnx}Whereas in CoffeeScript one can use until and destructuring assignment[13] instead:
gcd = (x, y) ->
  [x,y]=[y,x%y]untilyis0
  xAny for loop can be replaced by a list comprehension; so that to compute the squares of the positive odd numbers smaller than ten (i.e. numbers whose remainder modulo 2 is 1), one can do:
alertn*nfornin[1..10]whenn%2is1Alternatively, there is:
alertn*nfornin[1..10]by2A linear search can be implemented with a one-liner using the when keyword:
names = [""Ivan"",""Joanna"",""Nikolay"",""Mihaela""]linearSearch = (searchName) ->alert(name)fornameinnameswhennameissearchNameThe for ... in syntax allows looping over arrays while the for ... of syntax allows looping over objects.
The ? keyword quickly checks if a variable is null or undefined :
personCheck = ->
  ifnotperson?thenalert(""No person"")elsealert(""Have person"")person = nullpersonCheck()person = ""Ivan""personCheck()This would alert ""No person"" if the variable is null or undefined and ""Have person"" if there is something there.
A common JavaScript snippet using the jQuery library is:
$(document).ready(function(){
  // Initialization code goes here})Or even just:
$(function(){
  // Initialization code goes here})In CoffeeScript, the function keyword is replaced by the -> symbol, and indentation is used instead of curly braces, as in other off-side rule languages such as Python and Haskell.  Also, parentheses can usually be omitted, using indentation level instead to denote a function or block. Thus, the CoffeeScript equivalent of the snippet above is:
$(document).ready->
  # Initialization code goes hereOr just:
$->
  # Initialization code goes hereRuby-style string interpolation is included in CoffeeScript. Double-quoted strings allow for interpolated values, using #{ ... }, and single-quoted strings are literal.[14]author = ""Wittgenstein""quote  = ""A picture is a fact. -- #{author}""

sentence = ""#{22/7} is a decent approximation of π""CoffeeScript has been criticized for its unusual scoping
rules.[15][16] In particular, it completely disallows variable shadowing which makes reasoning about code more difficult and
error-prone in some basic programming patterns established
by and taken for granted since procedural programming
principles were defined.
For example, with the following code snippet in JavaScript
one does not have to look outside the {}-block to know for
sure that no possible foo variable in the outer scope can be
incidentally overridden:
  // ...
  functionbaz(){
    varfoo=""bar""
    console.log(`foo = ${foo}`)
  }
  // ...}In CoffeeScript there is no way to tell if the scope of a variable
is limited to a block or not without looking outside the block.
Development and distribution[edit]The CoffeeScript compiler has been self-hosting since version 0.5 and is available as a Node.js utility; however, the core compiler does not rely on Node.js and can be run in any JavaScript environment.[17] One alternative to the Node.js utility is the Coffee Maven Plugin, a plugin for the Apache Maven build system. The plugin uses the Rhino JavaScript engine written in Java.[citation needed]The official site at CoffeeScript.org has a ""Try CoffeeScript"" button in the menu bar; clicking it opens a modal window in which users can enter CoffeeScript, see the JavaScript output, and run it directly in the browser. The js2coffee[18] site provides bi-directional translation.
Latest additions[edit]Source maps allow users to de-bug their CoffeeScript code directly, supporting CoffeeScript tracebacks on run time errors.CoffeeScript supports a form of Literate Programming, using the .coffee.md or .litcoffee file extension. This allows CoffeeScript source code to be written in Markdown.  The compiler will treat any indented blocks (Markdown's way of indicating source code) as code, and ignore the rest as comments.Extensions[edit]Iced CoffeeScript is a superset of CoffeeScript which adds two new keywords: await and defer. These additions simplify asynchronous control flow, making the code to look more like a procedural programming language, eliminating the call-back chain. It can be used on the server side and in the browser.[19]Adoption[edit]On September 13, 2012, Dropbox announced that their browser-side code base has been rewritten from JavaScript to CoffeeScript,[20] however it has been migrated to TypeScript in 2017.[21]GitHub's internal style guide once said ""write new JS in CoffeeScript"", and while it no longer does, all the advice in the style guide references how to write good CoffeeScript,[22] and their Atom text editor is also written in the language.[23]See also[edit].mw-parser-output .portal{border:solid #aaa 1px;padding:0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tleft{margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tright{margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul{display:table;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0.1em;max-width:175px;background:#f9f9f9;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li{display:table-row}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:first-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:last-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle}Free and open-source software portalHaxeNim (programming language)Amber SmalltalkClojureDart (programming language)Kotlin (programming language)LiveScriptOpa (programming language)Elm (programming language)TypeScriptPureScriptReferences[edit]^""GitHub - jashkenas/coffeescript: Unfancy JavaScript"".

This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.
The set of jQuery core features—DOM element selections, traversal and manipulation—enabled by its selector engine (named ""Sizzle"" from v1.3), created a new ""programming style"", fusing algorithms and DOM data structures. This style influenced the architecture of other JavaScript frameworks like YUI v3 and Dojo, later stimulating the creation of the standard Selectors API.[7] Later, this style has been enhanced with a deeper algorithm-data fusion in an heir of jQuery, the D3.js framework.
Microsoft and Nokia bundle jQuery on their platforms.[8] Microsoft includes it with Visual Studio[9] for use within Microsoft's ASP.NET AJAX and ASP.NET MVC frameworks while Nokia has integrated it into the Web Run-Time widget development platform.[10]Contents1Overview2History2.1Popularity3Features3.1Browser support4Distribution5Interface5.1Functions5.1.1jQuery methods5.1.2Static utilities5.2No-conflict mode5.3Typical start-point5.4Chaining5.5Creating new DOM elements5.6Ajax6jQuery plug-ins7Release history8Testing framework9See also10References11Further reading12External links

Overview[edit]jQuery, at its core, is a Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation library. The DOM is a tree-structure representation of all the elements of a Web page. jQuery simplifies the syntax for finding, selecting, and manipulating these DOM elements. For example, jQuery can be used for finding an element in the document with a certain property (e.g. all elements with an h1 tag), changing one or more of its attributes (e.g. color, visibility), or making it respond to an event (e.g. a mouse click).
jQuery also provides a paradigm for event handling that goes beyond basic DOM element selection and manipulation. The event assignment and the event callback function definition are done in a single step in a single location in the code. jQuery also aims to incorporate other highly used JavaScript functionality (e.g. fade ins and fade outs when hiding elements, animations by manipulating CSS properties).
The principles of developing with jQuery are:
Separation of JavaScript and HTML: The jQuery library provides simple syntax for adding event handlers to the DOM using JavaScript, rather than adding HTML event attributes to call JavaScript functions. Thus, it encourages developers to completely separate JavaScript code from HTML markup.Brevity and clarity: jQuery promotes brevity and clarity with features like ""chainable"" functions and shorthand function names.Elimination of cross-browser incompatibilities: The JavaScript engines of different browsers differ slightly so JavaScript code that works for one browser may not work for another. Like other JavaScript toolkits, jQuery handles all these cross-browser inconsistencies and provides a consistent interface that works across different browsers.Extensibility: New events, elements, and methods can be easily added and then reused as a plugin.History[edit]jQuery was originally created in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by John Resig, influenced by Dean Edwards' earlier cssQuery library.[11][12] It is currently maintained by a team of developers led by Timmy Willison (with the jQuery selector engine, Sizzle, being led by Richard Gibson).[13]jQuery was originally licensed under the CC BY-SA 2.5, and relicensed to the MIT license in 2006.[14] At the end of 2006, it was dual-licensed under GPL and MIT licenses.[15] As this led to some confusion, in 2012 the GPL was dropped and is now only licensed under the MIT license.[16]Popularity[edit]In 2015, jQuery was used on 62.7% of the top 1 million websites (according to BuiltWith), and 17% of all Internet websites.[17]In 2017, jQuery was used on 69.2% of the top 1 million websites (according to Libscore).[6]In 2018, jQuery was used on 78% of the top 1 million websites.[18]In 2019, jQuery was used on 80% of the top 1 million websites (according to BuiltWith),[18] and 74.1% of the top 10 million (per W3Techs).[5]As of Feb 2020, jQuery is used by 74.4% of the top 10 million websites (according to W3Techs).[19]Features[edit]jQuery includes the following features:
DOM element selections using the multi-browser open source selector engine Sizzle, a spin-off of the jQuery project[20]DOM manipulation based on CSS selectors that uses elements' names and attributes, such as id and class, as criteria to select nodes in the DOMEventsEffects and animationsAjaxDeferred and Promise objects to control asynchronous processingJSON parsingExtensibility through plug-insUtilities, such as feature detectionCompatibility methods that are natively available in modern browsers, but need fallbacks for older browsers, such as jQuery.inArray() and jQuery.each().Cross-browser supportBrowser support[edit]jQuery 3.0 and newer supports ""current−1 versions"" (meaning the current stable version of the browser and the version that preceded it) of Firefox (and ESR), Chrome, Safari, and Edge as well as Internet Explorer9 and newer. On mobile it supports iOS 7 and newer, and Android 4.0 and newer.[21]Distribution[edit]The jQuery library is typically distributed as a single JavaScript file that defines all its interfaces, including DOM, Events, and Ajax functions. It can be included within a Web page by linking to a local copy, or by linking to one of the many copies available from public servers. jQuery has a content delivery network (CDN) hosted by MaxCDN.[22] Google in Google Hosted Libraries service and Microsoft host the library as well.[23][24]Example of linking a copy of the library locally (from the same server that hosts the Web page):
<scriptsrc=""jquery.js""></script>Example of linking a copy of the library from jQuery's public CDN:
<script
  src=""https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js""
  integrity=""sha256-CSXorXvZcTkaix6Yvo6HppcZGetbYMGWSFlBw8HfCJo=""
  crossorigin=""anonymous""></script>Interface[edit]Functions[edit]jQuery provides two kinds of functions, static utility functions and jQuery object methods. Each has its own usage style.
Both are accessed through jQuery's main identifier: jQuery. This identifier has an alias named $.[25] All functions can be accessed through either of these two names.
jQuery methods[edit]The jQuery function is a factory for creating a jQuery object that represents one or more DOM nodes. jQuery objects have methods to manipulate these nodes. These methods (sometimes called commands), are chainable as each method also returns a jQuery object.
Access to and manipulation of multiple DOM nodes in jQuery typically begins with calling the $ function with a CSS selector string. This returns a jQuery object referencing all the matching elements in the HTML page. $(""div.test""), for example, returns a jQuery object with all the div elements of class test. This node set can be manipulated by calling methods on the returned jQuery object.
Static utilities[edit]These are utility functions and do not directly act upon a jQuery object. They are accessed as static methods on the jQuery or $ identifier. For example, $.ajax() is a static method.
No-conflict mode[edit]jQuery provides a $.noConflict() function, which relinquishes control of the $ name. This is useful if jQuery is used on a Web page also linking another library that demands the  $ symbol as its identifier. In no-conflict mode, developers can use jQuery as a replacement for $ without losing functionality.[26]Typical start-point[edit]Typically, jQuery is used by putting initialization code and event handling functions in $(handler). This is triggered by jQuery when the browser has finished constructing the DOM for the current Web page.
$(function(){
        // This anonymous function is called when the page has completed loading.
        // Here, one can place code to create jQuery objects, handle events, etc.});or
$(fn);// The function named fn, defined elsewhere, is called when the page has loaded.Historically, $(document).ready(callback) has been the de facto idiom for running code after the DOM is ready. However, since jQuery 3.0, developers are encouraged to use the much shorter $(handler) signature instead.[27]Chaining[edit]jQuery object methods typically also return a jQuery object, which enables the use of method chains:
$('div.test')
  .on('click',handleTestClick)
  .addClass('foo');This line finds all divelements with class attribute test , then registers an event handler on each element for the ""click"" event, then adds the class attribute foo to each element.
Certain jQuery object methods retrieve specific values (instead of modifying state). An example of this is the val() method, which returns the current value of a text input element. In these cases, a statement such as $('#user-email').val() cannot be used for chaining as the return value does not reference a jQuery object.
Creating new DOM elements[edit]Besides accessing existing DOM nodes through jQuery, it is also possible to create new DOM nodes, if the string passed as the argument to $() factory looks like HTML. For example, the below code finds an HTML select element, and creates a new option element with value ""VAG"" and label ""Volkswagen"", which is then appended to the select menu:
$('select#car-brands')
  .append($('<option>')
    .attr({value:'VAG'})
    .text('Volkswagen')
  );Ajax[edit]It is possible to make Ajax requests (with cross-browser support) with $.ajax() to load and manipulate remote data.
$.ajax({
  type:'POST',
  url:'/process/submit.php',
  data:{
    name:'John',
    location:'Boston',
  },}).then(function(msg){
  alert('Data Saved: '+msg);}).catch(function(xmlHttpRequest,statusText,errorThrown){
  alert(
    'Your form submission failed.\n\n'
      +'XML Http Request: '+JSON.stringify(xmlHttpRequest)
      +',\nStatus Text: '+statusText
      +',\nError Thrown: '+errorThrown);});This example posts the data name=John and location=Boston to /process/submit.php on the server. When this request finishes the success function is called to alert the user. If the request fails it will alert the user to the failure, the status of the request, and the specific error.
The above example uses the  .then() and .catch() methods to register callbacks that run when the response has completed. These promise callbacks must be used due to the asynchronous nature of Ajax requests.
jQuery plug-ins[edit]jQuery's architecture allows developers to create plug-in code to extend its function. There are thousands of jQuery plug-ins available on the Web[28] that cover a range of functions, such as Ajax helpers, Web services, datagrids, dynamic lists, XML and XSLT tools, drag and drop, events, cookie handling, and modal windows.
An important source of jQuery plug-ins is the plugins sub-domain of the jQuery Project website.[28] The plugins in this subdomain, however, were accidentally deleted in December 2011 in an attempt to rid the site of spam.[29] The new site is a GitHub-hosted repository, which required developers to resubmit their plugins and to conform to new submission requirements.[30] jQuery provides a ""Learning Center"" that can help users understand JavaScript and get started developing jQuery plugins.[31]In order to create these plug-ins, developers can either choose to write their own code from scratch or build on top of an existing structure such as the jQuery Boilerplate.

Testing framework[edit]QUnit is a test automation framework used to test the jQuery project. The jQuery team developed it as an in-house unit testing library.[39] The jQuery team uses it to test its code and plugins, but it can test any generic JavaScript code, including server-side JavaScript code.[39]As of 2011, the jQuery Testing Team uses QUnit with TestSwarm to test each jQuery codebase release.[40]See also[edit].mw-parser-output .portal{border:solid #aaa 1px;padding:0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tleft{margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tright{margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul{display:table;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0.1em;max-width:175px;background:#f9f9f9;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li{display:table-row}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:first-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:last-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle}Free and open-source software portalComparison of JavaScript frameworksjQuery MobilejQuery UIReferences[edit]^ ab""jQuery 3.5.0 Released!"". jQuery Blog. 2020-04-10.

It brought increased focus on speed and modularity to Rails 3.[4][5] The name Merb is a contraction of ""Mongrel"" and ""Erb"".[6]Contents1Precursor to and merge with Rails 32Differences from Ruby on Rails2.1Modularity2.2Well-defined API2.3Performance and scalability3References4External links

Precursor to and merge with Rails 3[edit]Merb began as a ""clean-room"" implementation[7] of the Railscontroller stack, but grew to incorporate several ideas that deviated from Rails's spirit and methodology at the time, most notably component modularity, extensible API design, and vertical scalability. It was developed by Ezra Zygmuntowicz and Yehuda Katz. Most of these capabilities were added to Rails during the Rails 3/Merb merger.[8][9] Merb was first released at the 2008 RubyConf[10] and development has since stopped; Rails 3 therefore serves as both the successor to Rails 2 and the successor to Merb.
Differences from Ruby on Rails[edit]Merb's design attempted to address several criticisms of Rails 2: 
lack of component modularity (monolithic design)lack of an extensible APIlack of vertical scalabilityModularity[edit]Merb itself encompassed only the controller layer in MVC architecture, and used a suite of complementary, optional plugins together to assemble applications. The primary integration points were the web server interface, the model layer, the view layer, and controller extensions and add-ons. Merb's default application stack incorporated Datamapper for models, ERB for views, and Rack and Mongrel as the web server layer.[11][12]Well-defined API[edit]Before the Merb / Rails 3 merge, Rails lacked a well-defined, documented, public API for extensions and plug-ins, leading to issues when Rails changes broke monkey-patches performed by plug-ins. With the Rails 3 / Merb merge, Rails gained a defined public API with a test suite,[9] giving users and plugin developers a clearer, more stable API to build against, reducing plugin breakage from release to release.[8]Performance and scalability[edit]Some early versions of Rails received bad publicity for lack of performance, frequently due to developer confusion about ActiveRecord queries. David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of Rails, stated that Merb re-wrote many core Rails pieces to be faster,[8] and incorporated those changes from Merb in the Rails 3 merge, promising users that ""Rails 3 will get all the performance attention that the Merb guys are known for"".[8]References[edit]^Zygmuntowicz, Ezra.

It was created by Chad Fowler, Jim Weirich, David Alan Black, Paul Brannan and Richard Kilmer during RubyConf 2004.[2]The interface for RubyGems is a command-line tool called gem which can install and manage libraries (the gems).[3] RubyGems integrates with Ruby run-time loader to help find and load installed gems from standardized library folders. Though it is possible to use a private RubyGems repository, the public repository is most commonly used for gem management.
The public repository helps users find gems, resolve dependencies and install them. RubyGems is bundled with the standard Ruby package as of Ruby 1.9.[4]Contents1History2Structure of a gem3Working with gems3.1gem command3.1.1gem usage3.1.2gem package building4Security concerns5See also6References7External links

History[edit]Development on RubyGems started in November 2003 and was released to the public on March 14, 2004, or Pi Day 2004.[5] In 2010, the default public repository for gems moved from http://gems.rubyforge.org to http://rubygems.org, which is still in use. Also, RubyGems development was moved to GitHub in 2010. Though RubyGems has existed since Ruby 1.8, it was not a part of the standard Ruby distribution until Ruby 1.9.
Previously, compatibility with RubyGems and Ruby varied. Many versions of RubyGems are almost fully incompatible with many versions of Ruby and some versions had key features unusable. For example, Ruby 1.9 came with RubyGems 1.3.7 in its standard distribution, but RubyGems 1.4.x was not compatible with Ruby 1.9. This meant that updating RubyGems on Ruby 1.9 was not possible until RubyGems 1.5.0 was released in 2011, two years after the first stable release of Ruby 1.9.[6] These compatibility issues led to a rapid development of RubyGems, switching to a 4–6 week release schedule. This is reflected in there being 38 releases from 2004 to 2010 and 117 releases from 2011 to 2016. 45 versions were released in 2013, which is the highest number of releases in a year for RubyGems.[5]Structure of a gem[edit]Every gem contains a name, version and platform. Gems work only on ruby designed for a particular platform based on CPU architecture and operating-system type and version.[7]Each gem consists of:
CodeDocumentationGem specification (Gemspec)The code organization follows the following structure for a gem called gem_name:
gem_name/
├── bin/
│   └── gem_name
├── lib/
│   └── gem_name.rb
├── test/
│   └── test_gem_name.rb
├── README
├── Rakefile
└── gem_name.gemspec
The lib directory contains the code for the gem.The test (or spec) directory is used for testing.Rakefile is used by Rake to automate tests and to generate code.README includes the documentation, RDOC, for most gems.Gem specification (gemspec) contains information about the author of the gem, the time of creation and the purpose the gem serves.Working with gems[edit]Gems are packages similar to Ebuilds. They contain package information along with files to install.
Gems are usually built from "".gemspec"" files, which are YAML files containing information on gems. However, Ruby code may also build gems directly. Such a practice is usually used with Rake.
gem command[edit]The gem command is used to build, upload, download, and install gem packages.
gem usage[edit]RubyGems is very similar to apt-get, portage, yum and npm in functionality.
Installation:
gem install mygem
Uninstallation:
gem uninstall mygem
Listing installed gems:
gem list
Listing available gems, e.g.:
gem list --r
Create RDoc documentation for all gems:
gem rdoc --all
Adding a trusted certificate:[8]gem cert -a
Download but do not install a gem:
gem fetch mygem
Search available gems, e.g.:
gem search STRING --remote
gem package building[edit]The gem command may also be used to build and maintain .gemspec and .gem files.
Build .gem from a .gemspec file:
gem build mygem.gemspec
Security concerns[edit]Since ruby gems run their own code in an application it may lead to various security issues due to installation of malicious gems. The creator of malicious gems may be able to compromise the user system or server.[9]A number of methods have been developed to counter the security threat:
Cryptographic signing of gems since RubyGems version 0.8.11. The gem cert and gem install commands are used for this purpose.New signing models such as X509 and OpenPGP have been proposed and are actively being discussed among Ruby experts.See also[edit].mw-parser-output .portal{border:solid #aaa 1px;padding:0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tleft{margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tright{margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul{display:table;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0.1em;max-width:175px;background:#f9f9f9;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li{display:table-row}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:first-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:last-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle}Free and open-source software portalRuby Version ManagerPackage managerPip (package manager)Npm (software)LuaRocksReferences[edit]^""Release 3.2.1"". 14 December 2020.

   / June 15, 2020; 6 months ago (2020-06-15)[1]Repositorygithub.com/rack/rackOperating systemCross-platformTypeMiddlewareLicenseMIT LicenseWebsiterack.github.io Rack is a modular interface between web servers and web applications developed in the Ruby programming language. With Rack, application programming interfaces (APIs) for web frameworks and middleware are wrapped into a single method call handling HTTP requests and responses.
Rack is used by many Ruby web frameworks and libraries, such as Ruby on Rails and Sinatra. It is available as a Ruby Gem. Many Ruby applications are called ""rack-compliant"".[2]Rack has inspired similar frameworks in JavaScript[3] (jack.js), Clojure,[4]Perl (Plack), Common Lisp (Clack),[5] and .NET (OWIN).[6]Contents1Overview1.1Environment[7]1.2Rack response[7]1.3Middleware in racks[7]2Example application3See also4References5External links

Overview[edit]The characteristics of a Rack application is that the application object responds to the call method. The call method takes in the environment object as argument and returns the Rack response object.
Environment[7][edit]The environment that is taken as argument by the call method refers to an object that has:
a) Information on the HTTP Request
This includes the information like:
HTTP request methodThe URL information(information that would direct to the application, information that directs to the actual location in the application, Query string)Server information like the server name and server portThe HTTP metavariables that are received from the clientb) Rack specific information
This includes the information like
The version of the Rack application that is runningThe URL scheme that is used, that is, if the request that is received is http or https.The raw HTTP data.A Ruby object for reporting errors.Information like if the application object is simultaneously invoked from another thread or process.Information on the server expectations and capabilities (capability of the server for connection hijacking).In case the application is being used as a middleware, the environment can have objects that would provide session information, logging capabilities, information on the size of the data that can be used for read and writes etc. In addition to these, the server can store their own data in the environment.
Rack response[7][edit]The rack server object returns a response which contains three parts: the status, headers and the body.
The status contains the HTTP status codes such as 200,404.The header contains the response for each and gives the key-value pairs. The keys have to be strings.Body contains the final data which is sent by the server to the requester.Rack::Response provides a convenient interface to create a Rack response. The class Rack::Response is defined in lib/rack/response.rb. To use the Response class, instantiate it from the middleware layer down the stack. It can be used to modify the cookies.
Middleware in racks[7][edit]Rack makes it easy to add a chain of middleware components between the application and the web server. Multiple middleware components can be used in the rack which modifies the request/response before handing it over to the next component. This is called middleware stack.
The Rack server adds multiple middle middleware by default for the functionalities like showing exception with all the details,[8] validating the request and responses according to the Rack spec[9] etc.
Example application[edit]A Rack-compatible ""Hello World"" application in Ruby syntax:
# helloWorld.ru# The application that has the call method defined.classHelloWorld
  # Call method that would return the HTTP status code, the content type and the content.
  defcall(env)
    [200,{""Content-Type""=>""text/html; charset=utf-8""},[""Hello World""]]
  endendThe server for the above code can be initiated using ""rackup helloWorld.ru"" and can be accessed at http://localhost:9292/ The default port used by the Rack application is 9292.

(June 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)FastCGI is a binary protocol for interfacing interactive programs with a web server. It is a variation on the earlier Common Gateway Interface (CGI). FastCGI's main aim is to reduce the overhead related to interfacing between web server and CGI programs, allowing a server to handle more web page requests per unit of time.
Contents1History2Implementation details3Web servers that implement FastCGI4Language bindings for its API5References6External links

History[edit]Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a protocol for interfacing external applications to web servers. CGI applications run in separate processes, which are created at the start of each request and torn down at the end. This ""one new process per request"" model makes CGI programs very simple to implement, but limits efficiency and scalability. At high loads, the operating system overhead for process creation and destruction becomes significant. Also, the CGI process model limits resource reuse methods, such as reusing database connections, in-memory caching, etc.
To address the scalability shortcomings of CGI, Open Market developed FastCGI and first introduced it in their webserver product in the mid-1990s. Open Market originally developed FastCGI in part as a competitive response to Netscape's proprietary, in-process application programming interfaces (APIs) (Netscape Server Application Programming Interface (NSAPI)) for developing Web applications.
While developed first by Open Market, FastCGI was then implemented by several other webserver makers. However, its approach competed against other methods to speed and simplify server-subprogram communication. Apache HTTP Server modules such as mod_perl and mod_php appeared around the same time, and gained popularity quickly. As of 2020[update], all of these various methods, including CGI, remain in common use.
Implementation details[edit]Instead of creating a new process for each request, FastCGI uses persistent processes to handle a series of requests. These processes are owned by the FastCGI server, not the web server.[1]To service an incoming request, the web server sends environment variable information and the page request to a FastCGI process over either a Unix domain socket, a named pipe, or a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. Responses are returned from the process to the web server over the same connection, and the web server then delivers that response to the end user. The connection may be closed at the end of a response, but both web server and FastCGI service processes persist.[2]Each individual FastCGI process can handle many requests over its lifetime, thereby avoiding the overhead of per-request process creation and termination. Processing multiple requests concurrently can be done in several ways: by using one connection with internal multiplexing (i.e., multiple requests over one connection); by using multiple connections; or by a mix of these methods. Multiple FastCGI servers can be configured, increasing stability and scalability.
Web site administrators and programmers can find that separating web applications from the web server in FastCGI has many advantages over embedded interpreters (mod_perl, mod_php, etc.). This separation allows server and application processes to be restarted independently – an important consideration for busy web sites. It also enables the implementation of per-application, hosting service security policies, which is an important requirement for ISPs and web hosting companies.[3] Different types of incoming requests can be distributed to specific FastCGI servers which have been equipped to handle those types of requests efficiently.
Web servers that implement FastCGI[edit]See also: Comparison of web server software § FeaturesNote: unless stated, completeness of FastCGI implementation is unknownApache HTTP Server(partial)Implemented by .mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace}mod_fcgid. This module used to be third-party, but was granted to The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) as an Apache Server subproject in 2009, shepherded by Chris Darroch.[4] It only supports Unix domain sockets, no TCP sockets.[5]A third-party module mod_fastcgi is also being used. For a while, this module no longer compiled properly under Apache 2.4.x,[6] although that problem has been solved with a fork of the original project.[7]Multiplexing of requests through one connection is prohibited by Apache 1.x design,[8] so this isn't supportedIn Apache 2.4, mod_proxy_fcgi was added, supporting TCP FastCGI servers.Caddy[9]Cherokee[10]Hiawatha[11]Loadbalancing FastCGI supportSupports chrooted FastCGI serversJetty[12]Kerio WebSTARLighttpd[13]LiteSpeed Web ServerMicrosoft IIS[14]NginxNaviServerOracle iPlanet Web ServerOpenBSD's httpd(8)[15]Open Market web serverResin web and application serverRoxen web serverShimmerCat web server[16]Zeus Web ServerLanguage bindings for its API[edit]FastCGI can be implemented in any language that supports network sockets.

"18 December 2020, at 19:39","Interface which offers a standard protocol for web servers to execute programs installThis article is about the software interface between a web server and programs. For other uses, see CGI (disambiguation).In computing, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is an interface specification for web servers to execute programs like console applications (also called command-line interface programs) running on a server that generates web pages dynamically. Such programs are known as CGI scripts or simply as CGIs. The specifics of how the script is executed by the server are determined by the server.  In the common case, a CGI script executes at the time a request is made and generates HTML.[1]In brief, an HTTP GET or POST request from the client may send HTML form data to the CGI program via standard input. Other data, such as URL paths, and HTTP header data, are presented as process environment variables.

History[edit]  The official CGI logo from the spec announcementIn 1993 the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) team wrote the specification for calling command line executables on the www-talk mailing list.[2][3][4] The other Web server developers adopted it, and it has been a standard for Web servers ever since. A work group chaired by Ken Coar started in November 1997 to get the NCSA definition of CGI more formally defined.[5] This work resulted in RFC 3875, which specified CGI Version 1.1. Specifically mentioned in the RFC are the following contributors:[1]Rob McCool (author of the NCSA HTTPdWeb Server)John Franks (author of the GN Web Server)Ari Luotonen (the developer of the CERN httpd Web Server)Tony Sanders (author of the Plexus Web Server)George Phillips (Web server maintainer at the University of British Columbia)Historically CGI scripts were often written using the C language. RFC 3875 ""The Common Gateway Interface (CGI)"" partially defines CGI using C,[1] in saying that environment variables ""are accessed by the C library routine getenv() or variable environ"".
The name CGI comes from the early days of the web, where webmasters wanted to connect legacy information systems such as databases to their web servers. The CGI program was executed by the server that provided a common ""gateway"" between the web server and the legacy information system.
Purpose of the CGI specification[edit]Each web server runs HTTP server software, which responds to requests from web browsers. Generally, the HTTP server has a directory (folder), which is designated as a document collection — files that can be sent to Web browsers connected to this server.[6] For example, if the Web server has the domain name example.com, and its document collection is stored at /usr/local/apache/htdocs in the local file system, then the Web server will respond to a request for http://example.com/index.html by sending to the browser the (pre-written) file /usr/local/apache/htdocs/index.html.
For pages constructed on the fly, the server software may defer requests to separate programs and relay the results to the requesting client (usually, a web browser that displays the page to the end user).  In the early days of the web, such programs were usually small and written in a scripting language; hence, they were known as scripts.
Such programs usually require some additional information to be specified with the request. For instance, if Wikipedia were implemented as a script, one thing the script would need to know is whether the user is logged in and, if logged in, under which name.  The content at the top of a Wikipedia page depends on this information.
HTTP provides ways for browsers to pass such information to the web server, e.g. as part of the URL. The server software must then pass this information through to the script somehow.
Conversely, upon returning, the script must provide all the information required by HTTP for a response to the request: the HTTP status of the request, the document content (if available), the document type (e.g. HTML, PDF, or plain text), et cetera.
Initially, different server software would use different ways to exchange this information with scripts. As a result, it wasn't possible to write scripts that would work unmodified for different server software, even though the information being exchanged was the same.  Therefore, it was decided to specify a way for exchanging this information: CGI (the Common Gateway Interface, as it defines a common way for server software to interface with scripts).
Webpage generating programs invoked by server software that operate according to the CGI specification are known as CGI scripts.
This specification was quickly adopted and is still supported by all well-known server software, such as Apache, IIS, and (with an extension) node.js-based servers.
An early use of CGI scripts was to process forms. In the beginning of HTML, HTML forms typically had an ""action"" attribute and a button designated as the ""submit"" button. When the submit button is pushed the URI specified in the ""action"" attribute would be sent to the server with the data from the form sent as a query string. If the ""action"" specifies a CGI script then the CGI script would be executed and it then produces an HTML page.
Using CGI scripts[edit]A web server allows its owner to configure which URLs shall be handled by which CGI scripts.
This is usually done by marking a new directory within the document collection as containing CGI scripts — its name is often cgi-bin. For example, /usr/local/apache/htdocs/cgi-bin could be designated as a CGI directory on the web server. When a Web browser requests a URL that points to a file within the CGI directory (e.g., http://example.com/cgi-bin/printenv.pl/with/additional/path?and=a&query=string), then, instead of simply sending that file (/usr/local/apache/htdocs/cgi-bin/printenv.pl) to the Web browser, the HTTP server runs the specified script and passes the output of the script to the Web browser. That is, anything that the script sends to standard output is passed to the Web client instead of being shown on-screen in a terminal window.
As remarked above, the CGI specification defines how additional information passed with the request is passed to the script.
For instance, if a slash and additional directory name(s) are appended to the URL immediately after the name of the script (in this example, /with/additional/path), then that path is stored in the PATH_INFOenvironment variable before the script is called. If parameters are sent to the script via an HTTP GET request (a question mark appended to the URL, followed by param=value pairs; in the example, ?and=a&query=string), then those parameters are stored in the QUERY_STRING environment variable before the script is called. If parameters are sent to the script via an HTTP POST request, they are passed to the script's standard input. The script can then read these environment variables or data from standard input and adapt to the Web browser's request.[7]Example[edit]The following Perl program shows all the environment variables passed by the Web server:
#!/usr/bin/env perl

Some, but not all, of these variables are defined by the CGI standard.
Some, such as PATH_INFO, QUERY_STRING, and the ones starting with HTTP_, pass information along from the HTTP request.
From the environment, it can be seen that the Web browser is Firefox running on a Windows 7 PC, the Web server is Apache running on a system that emulates Unix, and the CGI script is named cgi-bin/printenv.pl.
The program could then generate any content, write that to standard output, and the Web server will transmit it to the browser.
The following are environment variables passed to CGI programs:
Server specific variables:SERVER_SOFTWARE: name/version of HTTP server.SERVER_NAME: host name of the server, may be dot-decimal IP address.GATEWAY_INTERFACE: CGI/version.Request specific variables:SERVER_PROTOCOL: HTTP/version.SERVER_PORT: TCP port (decimal).REQUEST_METHOD: name of HTTP method (see above).PATH_INFO: path suffix, if appended to URL after program name and a slash.PATH_TRANSLATED: corresponding full path as supposed by server, if PATH_INFO is present.SCRIPT_NAME: relative path to the program, like /cgi-bin/script.cgi.QUERY_STRING: the part of URL after ? character. The query string may be composed of *name=value pairs separated with ampersands (such as var1=val1&var2=val2...) when used to submit form data transferred via GET method as defined by HTML application/x-www-form-urlencoded.REMOTE_HOST: host name of the client, unset if server did not perform such lookup.REMOTE_ADDR: IP address of the client (dot-decimal).AUTH_TYPE: identification type, if applicable.REMOTE_USER used for certain AUTH_TYPEs.REMOTE_IDENT: see ident, only if server performed such lookup.CONTENT_TYPE: Internet media type of input data if PUT or POST method are used, as provided via HTTP header.CONTENT_LENGTH: similarly, size of input data (decimal, in octets) if provided via HTTP header.Variables passed by user agent (HTTP_ACCEPT, HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE, HTTP_USER_AGENT, HTTP_COOKIE and possibly others) contain values of corresponding HTTP headers and therefore have the same sense.The program returns the result to the Web server in the form of standard output, beginning with a header and a blank line.
The header is encoded in the same way as an HTTP header and must include the MIME type of the document returned.[8] The headers, supplemented by the Web server, are generally forwarded with the response back to the user.
Here is a simple CGI program written in Python 3 along with the HTML that handles a simple addition problem.[9]add.html:
<!DOCTYPE html><html>
 <body>
  <formaction=""add.cgi""method=""POST"">
   <fieldset>
     <legend>Enter two numbers to add</legend>
     <label>First Number: <inputtype=""number""name=""num1""></label><br>
     <label>Second Number: <inputtype=""number""name=""num2""></label><br>
   </fieldset>
   <button>Add</button>
  </form>
 </body></html>add.cgi:
#!/usr/bin/env python3

importcgi,cgitbcgitb.enable()

input_data=cgi.FieldStorage()

print('Content-Type: text/html')# HTML is followingprint('')                         # Leave a blank lineprint('<h1>Addition Results</h1>')try:
    num1=int(input_data[""num1""].value)
    num2=int(input_data[""num2""].value)except:
    print('<output>Sorry, the script cannot turn your inputs into numbers (integers).</output>')
    raiseSystemExit(1)print('<output>{0} + {1} = {2}</output>'.format(num1,num2,num1+num2))This Python 3 CGI program gets the inputs from the HTML and adds the two numbers together.
Deployment[edit]A Web server that supports CGI can be configured to interpret a URL that it serves as a reference to a CGI script. A common convention is to have a cgi-bin/directory at the base of the directory tree and treat all executable files within this directory (and no other, for security) as CGI scripts. Another popular convention is to use filename extensions; for instance, if CGI scripts are consistently given the extension .cgi, the web server can be configured to interpret all such files as CGI scripts. While convenient, and required by many prepackaged scripts, it opens the server to attack if a remote user can upload executable code with the proper extension.
In the case of HTTP PUT or POSTs, the user-submitted data are provided to the program via the standard input. The Web server creates a subset of the environment variables passed to it and adds details pertinent to the HTTP environment.
Uses[edit]CGI is often used to process input information from the user and produce the appropriate output. An example of a CGI program is one implementing a wiki. The user agent requests the name of an entry; the Web server executes the CGI; the CGI program retrieves the source of that entry's page (if one exists), transforms it into HTML, and prints the result. The web server receives the input from the CGI and transmits it to the user agent. If the ""Edit this page"" link is clicked, the CGI populates an HTML textarea or other editing control with the page's contents, and saves it back to the server when the user submits the form in it.
Security[edit]CGI programs run, by default, in the security context of the web server. When first introduced a number of example scripts were provided with the reference distributions of the NCSA, Apache and CERN web servers to show how shell scripts or C programs could be coded to make use of the new CGI. One such example script was a CGI program called PHF that implemented a simple phone book.
In common with a number of other scripts at the time, this script made use of a function: escape_shell_cmd(). The function was supposed to sanitize its argument, which came from user input and then pass the input to the Unix shell, to be run in the security context of the web server. The script did not correctly sanitize all input and allowed new lines to be passed to the shell, which effectively allowed multiple commands to be run. The results of these commands were then displayed on the web server. If the security context of the web server allowed it, malicious commands could be executed by attackers.
This was the first widespread example of a new type of web based attack, where unsanitized data from web users could lead to execution of code on a web server. Because the example code was installed by default, attacks were widespread and led to a number of security advisories in early 1996.[10]Alternatives[edit]Calling a command generally means the invocation of a newly created process on the server. Starting the process can consume much more time and memory than the actual work of generating the output, especially when the program still needs to be interpreted or compiled.
If the command is called often, the resulting workload can quickly overwhelm the server.
The overhead involved in process creation can be reduced by techniques such as FastCGI that ""prefork"" interpreter processes, or by running the application code entirely within the web server, using extension modules such as mod_perl or mod_php. Another way to reduce the overhead is to use precompiled CGI programs, e.g. by writing them in languages such as C or C++, rather than interpreted or compiled-on-the-fly languages such as Perl or PHP, or by implementing the page generating software as a custom webserver module.
Alternative approaches include:
Extensions such as Apache modules, NSAPI plugins, and ISAPI plugins allow third-party software to run on the web server.  Web 2.0 allows to transfer data from the client to the server without using HTML forms and without the user noticing.[11]FastCGI reduces overhead by allowing a single, long-running process to handle more than one user request. Unlike converting an application to a web server plug-in, FastCGI applications remain independent of the web server.Simple Common Gateway Interface or SCGI is designed to be easier to implement, yet it reduces latency in some operations compared to CGI.Replacement of the architecture for dynamic websites can also be used. This is the approach taken by Java EE, which runs Java code in a Java servlet container in order to serve dynamic content and optionally static content. This approach replaces the overhead of generating and destroying processes with the much lower overhead of generating and destroying threads, and also exposes the programmer to the library that comes with Java Platform, Standard Edition on which the version of Java EE in use is based.The optimal configuration for any Web application depends on application-specific details, amount of traffic, and complexity of the transaction; these tradeoffs need to be analyzed to determine the best implementation for a given task and time budget.  Web Frameworks offer an alternative to using CGI scripts to interact with user agents.

It can be described as ""software glue"".[1]Middleware makes it easier for software developers to implement communication and input/output, so they can focus on the specific purpose of their application. It gained popularity in the 1980s as a solution to the problem of how to link newer applications to older legacy systems, although the term had been in use since 1968.[2]

In distributed applications[edit]Main article: Middleware (distributed applications)  Software architecture: MiddlewareThe term is most commonly used for software that enables communication and management of data in distributed applications. An IETF workshop in 2000 defined middleware as ""those services found above the transport (i.e. over TCP/IP) layer set of services but below the application environment"" (i.e. below application-level APIs).[3] In this more specific sense middleware can be described as the dash (""-"") in client-server, or the -to- in peer-to-peer. Middleware includes web servers, application servers, content management systems, and similar tools that support application development and delivery.[4]ObjectWeb defines middleware as: ""The software layer that lies between the operating system and applications on each side of a distributed computing system in a network.""[5] Services that can be regarded as middleware include enterprise application integration, data integration, message oriented middleware (MOM), object request brokers (ORBs), and the enterprise service bus (ESB).[6]Database access services are often characterised as middleware. Some of them are language specific implementations and support heterogeneous features and other related communication features.[7] Examples of database-oriented middleware include ODBC, JDBC and transaction processing monitors.[8]Distributed computing system middleware can loosely be divided into two categories—those that provide human-time services (such as web request servicing) and those that perform in machine-time. This latter middleware is somewhat standardized through the Service Availability Forum[9] and is commonly used in complex, embedded systems within telecom, defence and aerospace industries.[10]Other examples[edit]The term middleware is used in other contexts as well. Middleware is sometimes used in a similar sense to a software driver, an abstraction layer that hides detail about hardware devices or other software from an application.
The Android operating system uses the Linux kernel at its core, and also provides an application framework that developers incorporate into their applications. In addition, Android provides a middleware layer including libraries that provide services such as data storage, screen display, multimedia, and web browsing. Because the middleware libraries are compiled to machine language, services execute quickly. Middleware libraries also implement device-specific functions, so applications and the application framework need not concern themselves with variations between various Android devices. Android's middleware layer also contains the ARTvirtual machine and its core Java application libraries.[11]Middleware also refers to the software that separates two or more APIs and provides services such as rate-limiting, authentication, and logging.Game engine software such as Gamebryo and RenderWare are sometimes described as middleware, because they provide many services to simplify game development.[12]In simulation technology, middleware is generally used in the context of the high level architecture (HLA) that applies to many distributed simulations. It is a layer of software that lies between the application code and the run-time infrastructure. Middleware generally consists of a library of functions, and enables a number of applications—simulations or federates in HLA terminology—to page these functions from the common library rather than re-create them for each application.[13]Wireless networking developers can use middleware to meet the challenges associated with a wireless sensor network (WSN). Implementing a middleware application allows WSN developers to integrate operating systems and hardware with the wide variety of various applications that are currently available.[14]The QNX operating system offers middleware for providing multimedia services for use in automobiles, aircraft and other environments.[15]Radio-frequency identification (RFID) software toolkits provide middleware to filter noisy and redundant raw data.[16]See also[edit]Language-agnosticThird-party software componentReferences[edit]^""What is Middleware?"".

They use a queue for messaging – the passing of control or of content.  Group communication systems provide similar kinds of functionality.
The message queue paradigm is a sibling of the publisher/subscriber pattern, and is typically one part of a larger message-oriented middleware system. Most messaging systems support both the publisher/subscriber and message queue models in their API, e.g. Java Message Service (JMS).

Remit and ownership[edit]Message queues implement an asynchronous communication pattern between two or more processes/threads whereas the sending and receiving party do not need to interact with the message queue at the same time. Messages placed onto the queue are stored until the recipient retrieves them.  Message queues have implicit or explicit limits on the size of data that may be transmitted in a single message and the number of messages that may remain outstanding on the queue.[1]RemitMany implementations of message queues function internally within an operating system or within an application. Such queues exist for the purposes of that system only.[2][3][4]Other implementations allow the passing of messages between different computer systems, potentially connecting multiple applications and multiple operating systems.[5]  These message queuing systems typically provide resilience functionality to ensure that messages do not get ""lost"" in the event of a system failure.  Examples of commercial implementations of this kind of message queuing software (also known as message-oriented middleware) include IBM MQ (formerly MQ Series) and Oracle Advanced Queuing (AQ).  There is a Java standard called Java Message Service, which has several proprietary and free software implementations.
Real-time operating systems (RTOSes) such as VxWorks and QNX encourage the use of message queuing as the primary inter-process or inter-thread communication mechanism.  This can result in integration between message passing and CPU scheduling.  Early examples of commercial RTOSes that encouraged a message-queue basis to inter-thread communication also include VRTX and pSOS+, both of which date to the early 1980s. The Erlang programming language uses processes to provide concurrency; these processes communicate asynchronously using message queuing.
OwnershipThe message queue software can be either proprietary, open source or a mix of both. It is then on run either on premise in private servers or on external cloud servers (message queuing service).
Proprietary options have the longest history, and include products from the inception of message queuing, such as IBM MQ, and those tied to specific operating systems, such as Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ). Cloud service providers also provide their proprietary solutions such as Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), StormMQ, Solace, and IBM MQ.Open source choices of messaging middleware systems includes Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Kafka, Apache Qpid, Apache RocketMQ, Enduro/X, JBoss Messaging, JORAM, RabbitMQ, Sun Open Message Queue, and Tarantool.Examples on hardware-based messaging middleware vendors are Solace, Apigee, and IBM MQ.
Usage[edit]In a typical message-queueing implementation, a system administrator installs and configures message-queueing software (a queue manager or broker), and defines a named message queue. Or they register with a message queuing service.
An application then registers a software routine that ""listens"" for messages placed onto the queue.
Second and subsequent applications may connect to the queue and transfer a message onto it.
The queue-manager software stores the messages until a receiving application connects and then calls the registered software routine.  The receiving application then processes the message in an appropriate manner.
There are often numerous options as to the exact semantics of message passing, including:
Durability - messages may be kept in memory, written to disk, or even committed to a DBMS if the need for reliability indicates a more resource-intensive solution.Security policies - which applications should have access to these messages?Message purging policies - queues or messages may have a ""time to live""Message filtering - some systems support filtering data so that a subscriber may only see messages matching some pre-specified criteria of interestDelivery policies - do we need to guarantee that a message is delivered at least once, or no more than once?Routing policies - in a system with many queue servers, what servers should receive a message or a queue's messages?Batching policies - should messages be delivered immediately?   Or should the system wait a bit and try to deliver many messages at once?Queuing criteria - when should a message be considered ""enqueued""?  When one queue has it?  Or when it has been forwarded to at least one remote queue?  Or to all queues?Receipt notification - A publisher may need to know when some or all subscribers have received a message.These are all considerations that can have substantial effects on transaction semantics, system reliability, and system efficiency.
Standards and protocols[edit]Historically, message queuing has used proprietary, closed protocols, restricting the ability for different operating systems or programming languages to interact in a heterogeneous set of environments.
An early attempt to make message queuing more ubiquitous was Sun Microsystems' JMS specification, which provided a Java-only abstraction of a client API. This allowed Java developers to switch between providers of message queuing in a fashion similar to that of developers using SQL databases. In practice, given the diversity of message queuing techniques and scenarios, this wasn't always as practical as it could be.
Three standards have emerged which are used in open source message queue implementations:
Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) – feature-rich message queue protocol, approved as ISO/IEC 19464 since April 2014Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) – simple, text-oriented message protocolMQTT (formerly MQ Telemetry Transport) - lightweight message queue protocol especially for embedded devicesThese protocols are at different stages of standardization and adoption. The first two operate at the same level as HTTP, MQTT at the level of TCP/IP.
Some proprietary implementations also use HTTP to provide message queuing by some implementations, such as Amazon's SQS. This is because it is always possible to layer asynchronous behaviour (which is what is required for message queuing) over a synchronous protocol using request-response semantics. However, such implementations are constrained by the underlying protocol in this case and may not be able to offer the full fidelity or set of options required in message passing above.
Synchronous vs. asynchronous[edit]Many of the more widely known communications protocols in use operate synchronously.  The HTTP protocol – used in the World Wide Web and in web services – offers an obvious example where a user sends a request for a web page and then waits for a reply.
However, scenarios exist in which synchronous behaviour is not appropriate.  For example, AJAX (AsynchronousJavaScript and XML) can be used to asynchronously send text, JSON or XML messages to update part of a web page with more relevant information.  Google uses this approach for their Google Suggest, a search feature which sends the user's partially typed queries to Google's servers and returns a list of possible full queries the user might be interested in the process of typing. This list is asynchronously updated as the user types.
Other asynchronous examples exist in event notification systems and publish/subscribe systems.
An application may need to notify another that an event has occurred, but does not need to wait for a response.In publish/subscribe systems, an application ""publishes"" information for any number of clients to read.In both of the above examples it would not make sense for the sender of the information to have to wait if, for example, one of the recipients had crashed.
Applications need not be exclusively synchronous or asynchronous. An interactive application may need to respond to certain parts of a request immediately (such as telling a customer that a sales request has been accepted, and handling the promise to draw on inventory), but may queue other parts (such as completing calculation of billing, forwarding data to the central accounting system, and calling on all sorts of other services) to be done some time later.
In all these sorts of situations, having a subsystem which performs message-queuing (or alternatively, a broadcast messaging system) can help improve the behavior of the overall system.
Implementation in UNIX[edit]There are two common message queue implementations in UNIX. One is part of the SYS V API, the other one is part of POSIX.
SYS V[edit]UNIX SYS V implements message passing by keeping an array of linked lists as message queues. Each message queue is identified by its index in the array, and has a unique descriptor. A given index can have multiple possible descriptors. UNIX gives standard functions to access the message passing feature.[6]msgget()This system call takes a key as an argument and returns a descriptor of the queue with the matching key if it exists. If it does not exist, and the IPC_CREAT flag is set, it makes a new message queue with the given key and returns its descriptor.msgrcv()Used to receive a message from a given queue descriptor. The caller process must have read permissions for the queue. It is of two types.[7]Blocking receive puts the child to sleep if it cannot find a requested message type. It sleeps till another message is posted in the queue, and then wakes up to check again.Non-blocking receive returns immediately to the caller, mentioning that it failed.msgctl()Used to change message queue parameters like the owner. Most importantly, it is used to delete the message queue by passing the IPC_RMID flag. A message queue can be deleted only by its creator, owner, or the superuser.POSIX[edit]The POSIX.1-2001 message queue API is the later of the two UNIX message queue APIs. It is distinct from the SYS V API, but provides similar function. The unix man page mq_overview(7) provides an overview of POSIX message queues.
Graphical user interfaces[edit]Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) employ a message queue, also called an event queue or input queue, to pass graphical input actions, such as mouse clicks, keyboard events, or other user inputs, to the application program.[8] The windowing system places messages indicating user or other events, such as timer ticks or messages sent by other threads, into the message queue. The GUI application removes these events one at a time by calling a routine called getNextEvent() or similar in an event loop, and then calling the appropriate application routine to process that event.[9]See also[edit].mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)Amazon Simple Queue ServiceApache ActiveMQApache QpidCelery (software)GearmanIBM Integration BusIBM MQJava Message ServiceMQTTMessage-oriented middleware, (category)Microsoft Message Queuing (known colloquially as MSMQ)NATSOracle Messaging Cloud ServiceRabbitMQRedisStormMQ, an example of a message queuing serviceTIBCO Enterprise Message ServiceEnduro/X Middleware platformZeroMQReferences[edit]^Dive Into Queue Module In Python.

History[edit]Yukihiro Matsumoto (""Matz"") started working on Ruby on February 24, 1993, and released it to the public in 1995.  ""Ruby"" was named as a gemstone because of a joke within Matsumoto's circle of friends alluding to the name of the Perl programming language.[5]The 1.8 branch has been maintained until June 2013,[6] and 1.8.7 releases have been released since April 2008.[7][8] This version provides bug fixes, but also many Ruby feature enhancements.
The RubySpec project has independently created a large test suite that captures 1.8.6/1.8.7/1.9  behavior as a reference conformance tool. Ruby MRI 1.9.2 passed over 99% of RubySpec.,[9] MRI Ruby 2.2 crashed on one of the tests. As a result of the limited uptake by the MRI developers, RubySpec project has been discontinued as of end of 2014.[3]Licensing terms[edit]Prior to release 1.9.3, the Ruby interpreter and libraries were distributed as dual-licensedfree and open source software, under the GNU General Public License or the Ruby License.[10]  In release 1.9.3, Ruby's License has been changed from a dual license with GPLv2 to a dual license with the 2-clause BSD license.[11]Operating systems[edit]Ruby MRI is available for the following operating systems (supported Ruby versions can be different):

History[edit]Apress, Inc. ,  based in New York and founded in 1999.[1] Apress was founded by authors Gary Cornell  and Dan Appleman. The main focus of Apress is to produce books for software developers, IT professionals and programmers. Its original name was Author's Press shortened to APress, then Apress. In 2003, Apress purchased much of the intellectual property of the designer-oriented publisher friends of ED. Topics covered relate largely to programming issues, on both proprietary and open source platforms. Hardware hacking is also a theme, and Apress has published some books aimed for mainstream consumer electronics users. In addition, Apress crosses over the IT line and publishes business books. Apress uses computer industry leaders to produce in partnership the best technical books in their chosen specialist computer fields. Apress also reviews all books before publishing to ensure they are technically correct like a software company does prior to releasing new software. Many of their published books have source codes attached to them so that readers can learn the skills associated with said work. 
Apress authors include Andrew Troelsen, Adam Freeman, Ed Yourdon, Matt MacDonald, Andy Budd, Rob Harrop, Dave Mark, Robert Ciesla, Michael A. Banks, Keir Thomas, Malcolm Harkins, Jacob Lamm, Scott Donaldson, Peter Seibel, Bob Walsh, Rory Lewis, and Joel Spolsky. Their print books are distributed worldwide by Springer Science + Business Media, and they are also sold as eBooks and distributed online through the subscription services such as SpringerLink, Books 24X7 and Safari Online. In 2007 Apress was fully acquired by Springer. Prior to this Springer owned a minority stake,[2] and in 2009 Apress' offices in Berkeley, California closed and the business moved to Springer's headquarters in New York. 
In 2012 Apress announced their new ApressOpen line of books, providing ebooks free through all of their ebook, electronic subscription and sponsor's channels. Springer merged with Nature Publishing Group and other related companies to form Springer Nature in 2015.[3]Collaborations[edit]As well as collaborating with computer authors. Apress has also collaborated with software companies.[4]Alongside collaborations with large organisations Apress has also sought out collaborations with individuals who have produced work that they feel are worthy of publishing. One such collaboration was with the inventor of the iPhone application sketch, they brought the publishing rights to the book ""Little more than a month after releasing the iPhone Application Sketch Book its creator, Dean Kaplan, has already sold the publishing rights to Apress Publishing House for an undisclosed amount.""[5] this shows that Apress is looking for not only the kudos of working with big companies but also developing other ideas they think that their readers would be interested in.
ApressOpen[edit]In order to release Apress publications to a wider audience they have created ApressOpen where they currently have 25 completely free books to download.[6][7] In order to achieve this they are using Springerlink which allows  ""over 122,000,000 unique visitors per year as well as on Apress.com, Intel.com, and all major eBook and database platforms.""[1]Notable books[edit]Big Data Analytics with SparkPro C# 5.0 and the .NET 4.5 FrameworkBeginning iOS6 DevelopmentPro ASP.NET MVC4Pro JQueryiPhone and iPad Apps For Absolute BeginnersPro AndroidMostly Codeless Game DevelopmentTraders at WorkInventors at WorkPower PlaysManaging HumansBeginning ASP.NET 4.5 in C#Beginning Node.jsFixing and Flipping Real EstatePractical Common LispManaging Risk and Information SecurityGame Development with Ren'PyStartup: An Insiders Guide to Launching and Running a BusinessSQL Server Query Performance Tuning DistilledNumerical Methods using MATLABBooks in series[edit]Beginning PythonGimpLearn Objective-C on the MacBeginning iOS DevelopmentCoders at WorkBeginning Android GamesAndroid Tablets Made SimpleReferences[edit]^""Apress"". www.linkedin.com.

"20 December 2020, at 18:43","""Error handling"" redirects here. It is not to be confused with Error detection and correction.This article is about computing. For knowledge, see fact checking and problem solving.In computing and computer programming, exception handling is the process of responding to the occurrence of exceptions – anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing - during the execution of a program. In general, an exception breaks the normal flow of execution and executes a pre-registered exception handler; the details of how this is done depend on whether it is a hardware or software exception and how the software exception is implemented. It is provided by specialized programming language constructs, hardware mechanisms like interrupts, or operating system (OS) inter-process communication (IPC) facilities like signals. Some exceptions, especially hardware ones, may be handled so gracefully that execution can resume where it was interrupted.
An alternative approach to exception handling in software is error checking, which maintains normal program flow with later explicit checks for contingencies reported using special return values, an auxiliary global variable such as C's errno, or floating point status flags. Input validation, which preemptively filters exceptional cases, is also an approach.

In hardware[edit]Hardware exception mechanisms are processed by the CPU. It is intended to support, e.g., error detection, and redirects the program flow to error handling service routines. The state before the exception is saved, e.g., on the stack.[1]Hardware exception handling/traps: IEEE 754 floating point[edit]Exception handling in the IEEE 754floating point hardware standard refers in general to exceptional conditions and defines an exception as ""an event that occurs when an operation on some particular operands has no outcome suitable for every reasonable application. That operation might signal one or more exceptions by invoking the default or, if explicitly requested, a language-defined alternate handling.""
By default, an IEEE 754 exception is resumable and is handled by substituting a predefined value for different exceptions, e.g. infinity for a divide by zero exception, and providing status flags for later checking of whether the exception occurred (see C99 programming language for a typical example of handling of IEEE 754 exceptions). An exception-handling style enabled by the use of status flags involves: first computing an expression using a fast, direct implementation; checking whether it failed by testing status flags; and then, if necessary, calling a slower, more numerically robust, implementation.[2]The IEEE 754 standard uses the term ""trapping"" to refer to the calling of a user-supplied exception-handling routine on exceptional conditions, and is an optional feature of the standard. The standard recommends several usage scenarios for this, including the implementation of non-default pre-substitution of a value followed by resumption, to concisely handle removable singularities.[2][3][4]The default IEEE 754 exception handling behaviour of resumption following pre-substitution of a default value avoids the risks inherent in changing flow of program control on numerical exceptions. For example, in 1996 the maiden flight of the Ariane 5 (Flight 501) ended in a catastrophic explosion due in part to the Ada programming language exception handling policy of aborting computation on arithmetic error, which in this case was a 64-bit floating point to 16-bit integer conversion overflow.[3] In the Ariane Flight 501 case, the programmers protected only four out of seven critical variables against overflow due to concerns about the computational constraints of the on-board computer and relied on what turned out to be incorrect assumptions about the possible range of values for the three unprotected variables because they reused code from the Ariane 4, for which their assumptions were correct.[5] According to William Kahan, the loss of Flight 501 would have been avoided if the IEEE 754 exception-handling policy of default substitution had been used because the overflowing 64-bit to 16-bit conversion that caused the software to abort occurred in a piece of code that turned out to be completely unnecessary on the Ariane 5.[3] The official report on the crash (conducted by an inquiry board headed by Jacques-Louis Lions) noted that ""An underlying theme in the development of Ariane 5 is the bias towards the mitigation of random failure. The supplier of the inertial navigation system (SRI) was only following the specification given to it, which stipulated that in the event of any detected exception the processor was to be stopped. The exception which occurred was not due to random failure but a design error. The exception was detected, but inappropriately handled because the view had been taken that software should be considered correct until it is shown to be at fault. [...] Although the failure was due to a systematic software design error, mechanisms can be introduced to mitigate this type of problem. For example the computers within the SRIs could have continued to provide their best estimates of the required attitude information. There is reason for concern that a software exception should be allowed, or even required, to cause a processor to halt while handling mission-critical equipment. Indeed, the loss of a proper software function is hazardous because the same software runs in both SRI units. In the case of Ariane 501, this resulted in the switch-off of two still healthy critical units of equipment.""[6]From the processing point of view, hardware interrupts are similar to resumable exceptions, though they are typically unrelated to the user program's control flow.
Exception handling facilities provided by the operating system[edit]Unix-likeoperating systems provide facilities for handling exceptions in programs via IPC. Typically, interrupts caused by the execution of a process are handled by the interrupt service routines of the operating system, and the operating system may then send a signal to that process, which may have asked the operating system to register a signal handler to be called when the signal is raised, or let the operating system execute a default action (like terminating the program). Typical examples are SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL and SIGFPE.
Other operating systems, e.g., OS/360 and successors, may uses different approaches in place of or in addition to IPC.
In software[edit]Software exception handling and the support provided by software tools differs somewhat from what is understood by exception handling in hardware, but similar concepts are involved. In programming language mechanisms for exception handling, the term exception is typically used in a specific sense to denote a data structure storing information about an exceptional condition. One mechanism to transfer control, or raise an exception, is known as a throw. The exception is said to be thrown. Execution is transferred to a ""catch"".
From the point of view of the author of a routine, raising an exception is a useful way to signal that a routine could not execute normally - for example, when an input argument is invalid (e.g. value is outside of the domain of a function) or when a resource it relies on is unavailable (like a missing file, a hard disk error, or out-of-memory errors), or that the routine has detected a normal condition that requires special handling, e.g., attention, end of file. In systems without exceptions, routines would need to return some special error code. However, this is sometimes complicated by the semipredicate problem, in which users of the routine need to write extra code to distinguish normal return values from erroneous ones.
Programming languages differ substantially in their notion of what an exception is. Contemporary languages can roughly be divided into two groups:[7]Languages where exceptions are designed to be used as flow control structures: Ada, Java, Modula-3, ML, OCaml, PL/I, Python, and Ruby fall in this category.Languages where exceptions are only used to handle abnormal, unpredictable, erroneous situations: C++,[8] C#, Common Lisp, Eiffel, and Modula-2.Kiniry also notes that ""Language design only partially influences the use of exceptions, and consequently, the
manner in which one handles partial and total failures during system execution. The other major influence is examples of use, typically in core libraries and code examples in technical books, magazine articles, and online discussion forums, and in an organization’s code standards.""[7]Contemporary applications face many design challenges when considering exception handling strategies. Particularly in modern enterprise level applications, exceptions must often cross process boundaries and machine boundaries. Part of designing a solid exception handling strategy is recognizing when a process has failed to the point where it cannot be economically handled by the software portion of the process.[9]History[edit]Software exception handling developed in Lisp in the 1960s and 1970s. This originated in LISP 1.5 (1962), where exceptions were caught by the ERRSET keyword, which returned NIL in case of an error, instead of terminating the program or entering the debugger.[10] Error raising was introduced in MacLisp in the late 1960s via the ERR keyword.[10] This was rapidly used not only for error raising, but for non-local control flow, and thus was augmented by two new keywords, CATCH and THROW (MacLisp June 1972), reserving ERRSET and ERR for error handling. The cleanup behavior now generally called ""finally"" was introduced in NIL (New Implementation of LISP) in the mid- to late-1970s as UNWIND-PROTECT.[11] This was then adopted by Common Lisp. Contemporary with this was dynamic-wind in Scheme, which handled exceptions in closures. The first papers on structured exception handling were Goodenough (1975a) and Goodenough (1975b).[12] Exception handling was subsequently widely adopted by many programming languages from the 1980s onward.
PL/I used dynamically scoped exceptions, however more recent languages use lexically scoped exceptions. PL/I exception handling included events that are not errors, e.g., attention, end-of-file, modification of listed variables. While some more recent languages support non-error exceptions, their use is not common.[citation needed]Originally, software exception handling included both resumable exceptions (resumption semantics), like most hardware exceptions, and non-resumable exceptions (termination semantics). However, resumption semantics were considered ineffective in practice in the 1970s and 1980s (see C++ standardization discussion, quoted below)[13] and are no longer in common use, though provided by programming languages like Common Lisp,Dylan and PL/I.
Termination semantics[edit]Exception handling mechanisms in contemporary languages are typically non-resumable (""termination semantics"") as opposed to hardware exceptions, which are typically resumable. This is based on experience of using both, as there are theoretical and design arguments in favor of either decision; these were extensively debated during C++ standardization discussions 1989–1991, which resulted in a definitive decision for termination semantics.[13] On the rationale for such a design for the C++ mechanism, Stroustrup notes:
.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}[A]t the Palo Alto [C++ standardization] meeting in November 1991, we heard a brilliant summary of the arguments for termination semantics backed with both personal experience and data from Jim Mitchell (from Sun, formerly from Xerox PARC). Jim had used exception handling in half a dozen languages over a period of 20 years and was an early proponent of resumption semantics as one of the main designers and implementers of Xerox's Cedar/Mesa system. His message was
“termination is preferred over resumption; this is not a matter of opinion but a matter of years of experience. Resumption is seductive, but not valid.”
He backed this statement with experience from several operating systems. The key example was Cedar/Mesa: It was written by people who liked and used resumption, but after ten years of use, there was only one use of resumption left in the half million line system – and that was a context inquiry. Because resumption wasn't actually necessary for such a context inquiry, they removed it and found a significant speed increase in that part of the system. In each and every case where resumption had been used it had – over the ten years – become a problem and a more appropriate design had replaced it. Basically, every use of resumption had represented a failure to keep separate levels of abstraction disjoint.[12]Criticism[edit]A contrasting view on the safety of exception handling was given by Tony Hoare in 1980, describing the Ada programming language as having ""...a plethora of features and notational conventions, many of them unnecessary and some of them, like exception handling, even dangerous. [...] Do not allow this language in its present state to be used in applications where reliability is critical [...]. The next rocket to go astray as a result of a programming language error may not be an exploratory space rocket on a harmless trip to Venus: It may be a nuclear warhead exploding over one of our own cities.""[14]Exception handling is often not handled correctly in software, especially when there are multiple sources of exceptions; data flow analysis of 5 million lines of Java code found over 1300 exception handling defects.[15]
Citing multiple prior studies by others (1999–2004) and their own results, Weimer and Necula wrote that a significant problem with exceptions is that they ""create hidden control-flow paths that are difficult for programmers to reason about"".[15]:8:27Go was initially released with exception handling explicitly omitted, with the developers arguing that it obfuscated control flow.[16] Later, the exception-like panic/recover mechanism was added to the language, which the Go authors advise using only for unrecoverable errors that should halt the entire process.[17][18][19][20]Exceptions, as unstructured flow, increase the risk of resource leaks (such as escaping a section locked by a mutex, or one temporarily holding a file open) or inconsistent state. There are various techniques for resource management in the presence of exceptions, most commonly combining the dispose pattern with some form of unwind protection (like a finally clause), which automatically releases the resource when control exits a section of code.
Exception support in programming languages[edit]See also: Exception handling syntaxMany computer languages have built-in support for exceptions and exception handling. This includes ActionScript, Ada, BlitzMax, C++, C#, Clojure, COBOL, D, ECMAScript, Eiffel, Java, ML, Next Generation Shell, Object Pascal (e.g. Delphi, Free Pascal, and the like), PowerBuilder, Objective-C, OCaml, PHP (as of version 5), PL/I, PL/SQL, Prolog, Python, REALbasic, Ruby, Scala, Seed7, Smalltalk, Tcl, Visual Prolog and most .NET languages. Exception handling is commonly not resumable in those languages, and when an exception is thrown, the program searches back through the stack of function calls until an exception handler is found.
Some languages call for unwinding the stack as this search progresses. That is, if function .mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace}f, containing a handler  H for exception E, calls function g, which in turn calls function h, and an exception E occurs in h, then functions h and g may be terminated, and H in f will handle E.
Exception-handling languages without this unwinding are Common Lisp with its Condition System, PL/I and Smalltalk. All call the exception handler and do not unwind the stack; however, in PL/I, if the ""ON unit"" (exception handler) does a GOTO out of the ON unit, that will unwind the stack. The exception handler has the option to restart the computation, resume or unwind. This allows the program to continue the computation at exactly the same place where the error occurred (for example when a previously missing file has become available) or to implement notifications, logging, queries and fluid variables on top of the exception handling mechanism (as done in Smalltalk). The stackless implementation of the Mythryl programming language supports constant-time exception handling without stack unwinding.
Excluding minor syntactic differences, there are only a couple of exception handling styles in use. In the most popular style, an exception is initiated by a special statement (throw or raise) with an exception object (e.g. with Java or Object Pascal) or a value of a special extendable enumerated type (e.g. with Ada or SML). The scope for exception handlers starts with a marker clause (try or the language's block starter such as begin) and ends in the start of the first handler clause (catch, except, rescue). Several handler clauses can follow, and each can specify which exception types it handles and what name it uses for the exception object.
A few languages also permit a clause (else) that is used in case no exception occurred before the end of the handler's scope was reached.
More common is a related clause (finally or ensure) that is executed whether an exception occurred or not, typically to release resources acquired within the body of the exception-handling block. Notably, C++ does not provide this construct, since it encourages the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) technique which frees resources using destructors.
In its whole, exception handling code might look like this (in Java-like pseudocode):
try{
    line=console.readLine();

    if(line.length()==0){
        thrownewEmptyLineException(""The line read from console was empty!"");
    }

    console.printLine(""Hello %s!""%line);
    console.printLine(""The program ran successfully."");}catch(EmptyLineExceptione){
    console.printLine(""Hello!"");}catch(Exceptione){
    console.printLine(""Error: ""+e.message());}finally{
    console.printLine(""The program is now terminating."");}As a minor variation, some languages use a single handler clause, which deals with the class of the exception internally.
According to a 2008 paper by Westley Weimer and George Necula, the syntax of the try...finally blocks in Java is a contributing factor to software defects. When a method needs to handle the acquisition and release of 3–5 resources, programmers are apparently unwilling to nest enough blocks due to readability concerns, even when this would be a correct solution. It is possible to use a single try...finally block even when dealing with multiple resources, but that requires a correct use of sentinel values, which is another common source of bugs for this type of problem.[15]:8:6–8:7 Regarding the semantics of the try...catch...finally construct in general, Weimer and Necula write that ""While try-catch-finally is conceptually simple, it has the most complicated execution description in the language specification [Gosling et al. 1996] and requires four levels of nested “if”s in its official English description. In short, it contains a large number of corner cases that programmers often overlook.""[15]:8:13–8:14C supports various means of error checking, but generally is not considered to support ""exception handling,"" although the setjmp and longjmp standard library functions can be used to implement exception semantics.
Perl has optional support for structured exception handling.
Python's support for exception handling is pervasive and consistent. It's difficult to write a robust Python program without using its try and except keywords.[citation needed]Exception handling in UI hierarchies[edit]Recent front-end web frameworks, such as React and Vue, have introduced error handling mechanisms where errors propagate up the UI component hierarchy, in a way that is analogous to how errors propagate up the call stack in executing code.[21][22] Here the error boundary mechanism serves as an analogue to the typical try-catch mechanism. Thus a component can ensure that errors from its child components are caught and handled, and not propagated up to parent components.

For example, in Vue, a component would catch errors by implementing errorCapturedVue.component('parent',{
    template:'<div><slot></slot></div>',
    errorCaptured:(err,vm,info)=>alert('An error occurred');})Vue.component('child',{
    template:'<div>{{ cause_error() }}</div>'})When used like this in markup:<parent>
    <child></child></parent>The error produced by the child component is caught and handled by the parent component.[23]Exception handling implementation[edit]The implementation of exception handling in programming languages typically involves a fair amount of support from both a code generator and the runtime system accompanying a compiler. (It was the addition of exception handling to C++ that ended the useful lifetime of the original C++ compiler, Cfront.[24])  Two schemes are most common. The first, dynamic registration, generates code that continually updates structures about the program state in terms of exception handling.[25]  Typically, this adds a new element to the stack frame layout that knows what handlers are available for the function or method associated with that frame; if an exception is thrown, a pointer in the layout directs the runtime to the appropriate handler code. This approach is compact in terms of space, but adds execution overhead on frame entry and exit. It was commonly used in many Ada implementations, for example, where complex generation and runtime support was already needed for many other language features. Dynamic registration, being fairly straightforward to define, is amenable to proof of correctness.[26]The second scheme, and the one implemented in many production-quality C++ compilers, is a table-driven approach. This creates static tables at compile time and link time that relate ranges of the program counter to the program state with respect to exception handling.[27]  Then, if an exception is thrown, the runtime system looks up the current instruction location in the tables and determines what handlers are in play and what needs to be done. This approach minimizes executive overhead for the case where an exception is not thrown. This happens at the cost of some space, but this space can be allocated into read-only, special-purpose data sections that are not loaded or relocated until an exception is actually thrown.[28]  This second approach is also superior in terms of achieving thread safety[citation needed].
Other definitional and implementation schemes have been proposed as well.[29] For languages that support metaprogramming, approaches that involve no overhead at all (beyond the already present support for reflection) have been advanced.[30]Exception handling based on design by contract[edit]A different view of exceptions is based on the principles of design by contract and is supported in particular by the Eiffel language. The idea is to provide a more rigorous basis for exception handling by defining precisely what is ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" behavior. Specifically, the approach is based on two concepts:
Failure: the inability of an operation to fulfill its contract. For example, an addition may produce an arithmetic overflow (it does not fulfill its contract of computing a good approximation to the mathematical sum); or a routine may fail to meet its postcondition.Exception: an abnormal event occurring during the execution of a routine (that routine is the ""recipient"" of the exception) during its execution. Such an abnormal event results from the failure of an operation called by the routine.The ""Safe Exception Handling principle"" as introduced by Bertrand Meyer in Object-Oriented Software Construction then holds that there are only two meaningful ways a routine can react when an exception occurs:
Failure, or ""organized panic"": The routine fixes the object's state by re-establishing the invariant (this is the ""organized"" part), and then fails (panics), triggering an exception in its caller (so that the abnormal event is not ignored).Retry: The routine tries the algorithm again, usually after changing some values so that the next attempt will have a better chance to succeed.In particular, simply ignoring an exception is not permitted; a block must either be retried and successfully complete, or propagate the exception to its caller.
Here is an example expressed in Eiffel syntax. It assumes that a routine send_fast is normally the better way to send a message, but it may fail, triggering an exception; if so, the algorithm next uses send_slow, which will fail less often. If send_slow fails, the routine send as a whole should fail, causing the caller to get an exception.
send(m:MESSAGE)is
  -- Send m through fast link, if possible, otherwise through slow link.local
  tried_fast,tried_slow:BOOLEANdo
  iftried_fastthen
     tried_slow:=True
     send_slow(m)
  else
     tried_fast:=True
     send_fast(m)
  endrescue
  ifnottried_slowthen
     retry
  endendThe boolean local variables are initialized to False at the start. If  send_fast fails, the body (do clause) will be executed again, causing execution of send_slow. If this execution of send_slow fails, the rescue clause will execute to the end with no retry (no else clause in the final if), causing the routine execution as a whole to fail.
This approach has the merit of defining clearly what ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" cases are: an abnormal case, causing an exception, is one in which the routine is unable to fulfill its contract. It defines a clear distribution of roles: the do clause (normal body) is in charge of achieving, or attempting to achieve, the routine's contract; the rescue clause is in charge of reestablishing the context and restarting the process, if this has a chance of succeeding, but not of performing any actual computation.
Although exceptions in Eiffel have a fairly clear philosophy, Kiniry (2006) criticizes their implementation because ""Exceptions that are part of the language definition are represented by INTEGER values, developer-defined exceptions by STRING values. [...] Additionally, because they are basic values and not objects, they have no inherent semantics beyond that which is expressed in a helper routine which necessarily cannot be foolproof because of the representation overloading in effect (e.g., one cannot
differentiate two integers of the same value).""[7]Uncaught exceptions[edit]If an exception is thrown and not caught (operationally, an exception is thrown when there is no applicable handler specified), the uncaught exception is handled by the runtime; the routine that does this is called the uncaught exception handler.[31][32] The most common default behavior is to terminate the program and print an error message to the console, usually including debug information such as a string representation of the exception and the stack trace.[31][33][34] This is often avoided by having a top-level (application-level) handler (for example in an event loop) that catches exceptions before they reach the runtime.[31][35]Note that even though an uncaught exception may result in the program terminating abnormally (the program may not be correct if an exception is not caught, notably by not rolling back partially completed transactions, or not releasing resources), the process terminates normally (assuming the runtime works correctly), as the runtime (which is controlling execution of the program) can ensure orderly shutdown of the process.
In a multithreaded program, an uncaught exception in a thread may instead result in termination of just that thread, not the entire process (uncaught exceptions in the thread-level handler are caught by the top-level handler). This is particularly important for servers, where for example a servlet (running in its own thread) can be terminated without the server overall being affected.
This default uncaught exception handler may be overridden, either globally or per-thread, for example to provide alternative logging or end-user reporting of uncaught exceptions, or to restart threads that terminate due to an uncaught exception. For example, in Java this is done for a single thread via Thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler and globally via Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler; in Python this is done by modifying sys.excepthook.
Static checking of exceptions[edit]Checked exceptions[edit]The designers of Java devised[36] checked exceptions,[37] which are a special set of exceptions. The checked exceptions that a method may raise are part of the method's signature. For instance, if a method might throw an IOException, it must declare this fact explicitly in its method signature. Failure to do so raises a compile-time error.
Kiniry (2006) notes however that Java's libraries (as they were in 2006) were often inconsistent in their approach to error reporting, because ""Not all erroneous situations in Java are represented by exceptions though. Many methods return special values which indicate failure encoded as constant field of related classes.""[7]Checked exceptions are related to exception checkers that exist for the OCaml programming language.[38] The external tool for OCaml is both invisible (i.e. it does not require any syntactic annotations) and optional (i.e. it is possible to compile and run a program without having checked the exceptions, although this is not recommended for production code).
The CLU programming language had a feature with the interface closer to what Java has introduced later. A function could raise only exceptions listed in its type, but any leaking exceptions from called functions would automatically be turned into the sole runtime exception, failure, instead of resulting in compile-time error. Later, Modula-3 had a similar feature.[39] These features don't include the compile time checking that is central in the concept of checked exceptions, and hasn't (as of 2006) been incorporated into major programming languages other than Java.[40]Early versions of the C++ programming language included an optional mechanism for checked exceptions, called exception specifications. By default any function could throw any exception, but this was limited by a throw clause added to the function signature, that specified which exceptions the function may throw. Exception specifications were not enforced at compile-time. Violations resulted in the global function std::unexpected being called.[41]  An empty exception specification could be given, which indicated that the function will throw no exception. This was not made the default when exception handling was added to the language because it would have required too much modification of existing code, would have impeded interaction with code written in other languages, and would have tempted programmers into writing too many handlers at the local level.[41] Explicit use of empty exception specifications could, however, allow C++ compilers to perform significant code and stack layout optimizations that generally have to be suppressed when exception handling may take place in a function.[28]  Some analysts viewed the proper use of exception specifications in C++ as difficult to achieve.[42] In the recent[ref] C++ language standard (C++11), this use of exception specifications as specified in the C++03 version of the standard was deprecated and was removed from the language in C++17.[43] A function that will not throw any exceptions can now be denoted by the noexcept keyword.

In contrast to Java, languages like C# do not require declaration of any exception type. According to Hanspeter Mössenböck, not distinguishing between to-be-called (checked) exceptions and not-to-be-called (unchecked) exceptions makes the written program more convenient, but less robust, as an uncaught exception results in an abort with a stack trace.[44] Kiniry (2006) notes however that Java's JDK (version 1.4.1) throws a large number of unchecked exceptions: one for every 140 lines of code, whereas Eiffel uses them much more sparingly, with one thrown every 4,600 lines of code. Kiniry also writes that ""As any Java programmer knows, the volume of try catch code in a typical Java application is sometimes larger than the comparable code necessary for explicit formal parameter and return value checking in other languages that do not have checked exceptions. In fact, the general consensus among in-the-trenches Java programmers is that dealing with checked exceptions is nearly as unpleasant a task as writing documentation. Thus, many programmers report that they “resent” checked exceptions. This leads to an abundance of checked-but-ignored exceptions"".[7] Kiniry also notes that the developers of C# apparently were influenced by this kind of user experiences, with the following quote being attributed to them (via Eric Gunnerson): ""Examination of small programs leads to the conclusion that requiring exception specifications could both enhance developer productivity and enhance code quality, but experience with large software projects suggests a different result – decreased productivity and little or no increase in code quality.""[7] According to Anders Hejlsberg there was fairly broad agreement in their design group to not have checked exceptions as a language feature in C#. Hejlsberg explained in an interview that “The throws clause, at least the way it's implemented in Java, doesn't necessarily force you to handle the exceptions, but if you don't handle them, it forces you to acknowledge precisely which exceptions might pass through. It requires you to either catch declared exceptions or put them in your own throws clause. To work around this requirement, people do ridiculous things. For example, they decorate every method with, ""throws Exception."" That just completely defeats the feature, and you just made the programmer write more gobbledy gunk. That doesn't help anybody.”[45]Views on usage[edit]This section is written like a personal reflection, personal essay, or argumentative essay that states a Wikipedia editor's personal feelings or presents an original argument about a topic. Please help improve it by rewriting it in an encyclopedic style.  (July 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Checked exceptions can, at compile time, reduce the incidence of unhandled exceptions surfacing at runtime in a given application. Unchecked exceptions (such as the Java objects RuntimeException and Error) remain unhandled.
However, checked exceptions can either require extensive throws declarations, revealing implementation details and reducing encapsulation, or encourage coding poorly considered try/catch blocks that can hide legitimate exceptions from their appropriate handlers.[citation needed]  Consider a growing codebase over time. An interface may be declared to throw exceptions X and Y. In a later version of the code, if one wants to throw exception Z, it would make the new code incompatible with the earlier uses. Furthermore, with the adapter pattern, in which one body of code declares an interface that is then implemented by a different body of code so that code can be plugged in and called by the first, the adapter code may have a rich set of exceptions to describe problems, but is forced to use the exception types declared in the interface.
It is possible to reduce the number of declared exceptions either by declaring a superclass of all potentially thrown exceptions, or by defining and declaring exception types that are suitable for the level of abstraction of the called method[46] and mapping lower level exceptions to these types, preferably wrapped using exception chaining in order to preserve the root cause. In addition, it's very possible that in the example above of the changing interface that the calling code would need to be modified as well, since in some sense the exceptions a method may throw are part of the method's implicit interface anyway.
Using a throwsException declaration or catch(Exceptione) is usually sufficient for satisfying the checking in Java. While this may have some use, it essentially circumvents the checked exception mechanism, which Oracle discourages.[47]Unchecked exception types should generally not be handled, except possibly at the outermost levels of scope. These often represent scenarios that do not allow for recovery: RuntimeExceptions frequently reflect programming defects,[48] and Errors generally represent unrecoverable JVM failures. Even in a language that supports checked exceptions, there are cases where the use of checked exceptions is not appropriate.[49]Dynamic checking of exceptions[edit]The point of exception handling routines is to ensure that the code can handle error conditions. In order to establish that exception handling routines are sufficiently robust, it is necessary to present the code with a wide spectrum of invalid or unexpected inputs, such as can be created via software fault injection and mutation testing (that is also sometimes referred to as fuzz testing). One of the most difficult types of software for which to write exception handling routines is protocol software, since a robust protocol implementation must be prepared to receive input that does not comply with the relevant specification(s).
In order to ensure that meaningful regression analysis can be conducted throughout a software development lifecycle process, any exception handling testing should be highly automated, and the test cases must be generated in a scientific, repeatable fashion. Several commercially available systems exist that perform such testing.
In runtime engine environments such as Java or .NET, there exist tools that attach to the runtime engine and every time that an exception of interest occurs, they record debugging information that existed in memory at the time the exception was thrown (call stack and heap values). These tools are called automated exception handling or error interception tools and provide 'root-cause' information for exceptions.
Exception synchronicity[edit]Somewhat related with the concept of checked exceptions is exception synchronicity. Synchronous exceptions happen at a specific program statement whereas asynchronous exceptions can raise practically anywhere.[50][51] It follows that asynchronous exception handling can't be required by the compiler. They are also difficult to program with. Examples of naturally asynchronous events include pressing Ctrl-C to interrupt a program, and receiving a signal such as ""stop"" or ""suspend"" from another thread of execution.
Programming languages typically deal with this by limiting asynchronicity, for example Java has deprecated the use of its ThreadDeath exception that was used to allow one thread to stop another one.[52] Instead, there can be semi-asynchronous exceptions that only raise in suitable locations of the program or synchronously.
Condition systems[edit]Common Lisp, Dylan and Smalltalk have a condition system[53] (see Common Lisp Condition System) that encompasses the aforementioned exception handling systems. In those languages or environments the advent of a condition (a ""generalisation of an error"" according to Kent Pitman) implies a function call, and only late in the exception handler the decision to unwind the stack may be taken.
Conditions are a generalization of exceptions. When a condition arises, an appropriate condition handler is searched for  and selected, in stack order, to handle the condition. Conditions that do not represent errors may safely go unhandled entirely; their only purpose may be to propagate hints or warnings toward the user.[54]Continuable exceptions[edit]This is related to the so-called resumption model of exception handling, in which some exceptions are said to be continuable: it is permitted to return to the expression that signaled an exception, after having taken corrective action in the handler. The condition system is generalized thus: within the handler of a non-serious condition (a.k.a. continuable exception), it is possible to jump to predefined restart points (a.k.a. restarts) that lie between the signaling expression and the condition handler. Restarts are functions closed over some lexical environment, allowing the programmer to repair this environment before exiting the condition handler completely or unwinding the stack even partially.
An example is the ENDPAGE condition in PL/I; the ON unit might write page trailer lines and header lines for the next page, then fall through to resume execution of the interrupted code.
Restarts separate mechanism from policy[edit]Condition handling moreover provides a separation of mechanism from policy. Restarts provide various possible mechanisms for recovering from error, but do not select which mechanism is appropriate in a given situation. That is the province of the condition handler, which (since it is located in higher-level code) has access to a broader view.
An example: Suppose there is a library function whose purpose is to parse a single syslog file entry. What should this function do if the entry is malformed? There is no one right answer, because the same library could be deployed in programs for many different purposes. In an interactive log-file browser, the right thing to do might be to return the entry unparsed, so the user can see it—but in an automated log-summarizing program, the right thing to do might be to supply null values for the unreadable fields, but abort with an error, if too many entries have been malformed.
That is to say, the question can only be answered in terms of the broader goals of the program, which are not known to the general-purpose library function. Nonetheless, exiting with an error message is only rarely the right answer. So instead of simply exiting with an error, the function may establish restarts offering various ways to continue—for instance, to skip the log entry, to supply default or null values for the unreadable fields, to ask the user for the missing values, or to unwind the stack and abort processing with an error message. The restarts offered constitute the mechanisms available for recovering from error; the selection of restart by the condition handler supplies the policy.

In other words, ""runtime"" is the running phase of a program.
A runtime error is detected after or during the execution (running state) of a program, whereas a compile-time error is detected by the compiler before the program is ever executed. Type checking, register allocation, code generation, and code optimization are typically done at compile time, but may be done at runtime depending on the particular language and compiler. Many other runtime errors exist and are handled differently by different programming languages, such as division by zero errors, domain errors, array subscript out of bounds errors, arithmetic underflow errors, several types of underflow and overflow errors, and many other runtime errors generally considered as software bugs which may or may not be caught and handled by any particular computer language.

Implementation details[edit]When a program is to be executed, a loader first performs the necessary memory setup and links the program with any dynamically linkedlibraries it needs, and then the execution begins starting from the program's entry point. In some cases, a language or implementation will have these tasks done by the language runtime instead, though this is unusual in mainstream languages on common consumer operating systems.
Some program debugging can only be performed (or is more efficient or accurate when performed) at runtime. Logic errors and array bounds checking are examples. For this reason, some programming bugs are not discovered until the program is tested in a production environment with real data, despite sophisticated compile-time checking and pre-release testing. In this case, the end-user may encounter a ""runtime error"" message. 
Application errors (exceptions)[edit]Exception handling is one language feature designed to handle runtime errors, providing a structured way to catch completely unexpected situations as well as predictable errors or unusual results without the amount of inline error checking required of languages without it. More recent advancements in runtime engines enable automated exception handling which provides ""root-cause"" debug information for every exception of interest and is implemented independent of the source code, by attaching a special software product to the runtime engine.

Formal techniques, such as fuzz testing, are essential to showing robustness since this type of testing involves invalid or unexpected inputs. Alternatively, fault injection can be used to test robustness. Various commercial products perform robustness testing of software analysis.[3]Contents1Introduction2Challenges3Areas3.1Robust programming3.1.1Principles3.2Robust machine learning3.3Robust network design3.4Robust algorithms4See also5References

Introduction[edit]In general, building robust systems that encompass every point of possible failure is difficult because of the vast quantity of possible inputs and input combinations.[4] Since all inputs and input combinations would require too much time to test, developers cannot run through all cases exhaustively. Instead, the developer will try to generalize such cases.[5] For example, imagine inputting some integer values. Some selected inputs might consist of a negative number, zero, and a positive number. When using these numbers to test software in this way, the developer generalizes the set of all reals into three numbers. This is a more efficient and manageable method, but more prone to failure. Generalizing test cases is an example of just one technique to deal with failure—specifically, failure due to invalid user input. Systems generally may also fail due to other reasons as well, such as disconnecting from a network.
Regardless, complex systems should still handle any errors encountered gracefully. There are many examples of such successful systems. Some of the most robust systems are evolvable and can be easily adapted to new situations.[4]Challenges[edit]Programs and software are tools focused on a very specific task, and thus aren't generalized and flexible.[4] However, observations in systems such as the internet or biological systems demonstrate adaptation to their environments. One of the ways biological systems adapt to environments is through the use of redundancy.[4] Many organs are redundant in humans. The kidney is one such example. Humans generally only need one kidney, but having a second kidney allows room for failure. This same principle may be taken to apply to software, but there are some challenges.
When applying the principle of redundancy to computer science, blindly adding code is not suggested. Blindly adding code introduces more errors, makes the system more complex, and renders it harder to understand.[6] Code that doesn't provide any reinforcement to the already existing code is unwanted. The new code must instead possess equivalent functionality, so that if a function is broken, another providing the same function can replace it, using manual or automated software diversity. To do so, the new code must know how and when to accommodate the failure point.[4] This means more logic needs to be added to the system. But as a system adds more logic, components, and increases in size, it becomes more complex. Thus, when making a more redundant system, the system also becomes more complex and developers must consider balancing redundancy with complexity.
Currently, computer science practices do not focus on building robust systems.[4] Rather, they tend to focus on scalability and efficiency. One of the main reasons why there is no focus on robustness today is because it is hard to do in a general way.[4]Areas[edit]Robust programming[edit]Robust programming is a style of programming that focuses on handling unexpected termination and unexpected actions.[7] It requires code to handle these terminations and actions gracefully by displaying accurate and unambiguous error messages. These error messages allow the user to more easily debug the program.
Principles[edit]Paranoia - When building software, the programmer assumes users are out to break their code.[7] The programmer also assumes that his or her own written code may fail or work incorrectly.[7]Stupidity - The programmer assumes users will try incorrect, bogus and malformed inputs.[7] As a consequence, the programmer returns to the user an unambiguous, intuitive error message that does not require looking up error codes. The error message should try to be as accurate as possible without being misleading to the user, so that the problem can be fixed with ease.
Dangerous implements - Users should not gain access to libraries, data structures, or pointers to data structures.[7] This information should be hidden from the user so that the user doesn't accidentally modify them and introduce a bug in the code. When such interfaces are correctly built, users use them without finding loopholes to modify the interface. The interface should already be correctly implemented, so the user does not need to make modifications. The user therefore focuses solely on his or her own code.
Can't happen - Very often, code is modified and may introduce a possibility that an ""impossible"" case occurs. Impossible cases are therefore assumed to be highly unlikely instead.[7] The developer thinks about how to handle the case that is highly unlikely, and implements the handling accordingly.
Robust machine learning[edit]Robust machine learning typically refers to the robustness of machine learning algorithms. For a machine learning algorithm to be considered robust, either the testing error has to be consistent with the training error, or the performance is stable after adding some noise to the dataset.[8]Robust network design[edit]Robust network design is the study of network design in the face of variable or uncertain demands.[9] In a sense, robustness in network design is broad just like robustness in software design because of the vast possibilities of changes or inputs.
Robust algorithms[edit]There exists algorithms that tolerate errors in the input[10] or during the computation.[11] In that case, the computation eventually converges to the correct output. This phenomenon has been called ""correctness attraction"".[11]See also[edit]Defensive programmingNon-functional requirementReferences[edit]^""A Model-Based Approach for Robustness Testing""(PDF).

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document. Nodes can have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.[2]The principal standardization of the DOM was handled by the World Wide Web Consortium, which last developed a recommendation in 2004. WHATWG took over the development of the standard, publishing it as a living document. The W3C now publishes stable snapshots of the WHATWG standard.

History[edit]The history of the Document Object Model is intertwined with the history of the ""browser wars"" of the late 1990s between Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, as well as with that of JavaScript and JScript, the first scripting languages to be widely implemented in the JavaScript engines of web browsers.
JavaScript was released by Netscape Communications in 1995 within Netscape Navigator 2.0. Netscape's competitor, Microsoft, released Internet Explorer 3.0 the following year with a reimplementation of JavaScript called JScript. JavaScript and JScript let web developers create web pages with client-side interactivity. The limited facilities for detecting user-generated events and modifying the HTML document in the first generation of these languages eventually became known as ""DOM Level 0"" or ""Legacy DOM."" No independent standard was developed for DOM Level 0, but it was partly described in the specifications for HTML 4.
Legacy DOM was limited in the kinds of elements that could be accessed. Form, link and image elements could be referenced with a hierarchical name that began with the root document object. A hierarchical name could make use of either the names or the sequential index of the traversed elements. For example, a form input element could be accessed as either document.formName.inputName or document.forms[0].elements[0].
The Legacy DOM enabled client-side form validation and the popular ""rollover"" effect.
In 1997, Netscape and Microsoft released version 4.0 of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer respectively, adding support for Dynamic HTML (DHTML) functionality enabling changes to a loaded HTML document. DHTML required extensions to the rudimentary document object that was available in the Legacy DOM implementations. Although the Legacy DOM implementations were largely compatible since JScript was based on JavaScript, the DHTML DOM extensions were developed in parallel by each browser maker and remained incompatible. These versions of the DOM became known as the ""Intermediate DOM.""
After the standardization of ECMAScript, the W3C DOM Working Group began drafting a standard DOM specification. The completed specification, known as ""DOM Level 1"", became a W3C Recommendation in late 1998. By 2005, large parts of W3C DOM were well-supported by common ECMAScript-enabled browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6 (from 2001), Opera, Safari and Gecko-based browsers (like Mozilla, Firefox, SeaMonkey and Camino).
Standards[edit]The W3C DOM Working Group published its final recommendation and subsequently disbanded in 2004. Development efforts migrated to the WHATWG, which continues to maintain a living standard.[3] In 2009, the Web Applications group reorganized DOM activities at the W3C.[4] In 2013, due to a lack of progress and the impending release of HTML5, the DOM Level 4 specification was reassigned to the HTML Working Group to expedite its completion.[5] Meanwhile, in 2015, the Web Applications group was disbanded and DOM stewardship passed to the Web Platform group.[6] Beginning with the publication of DOM Level 4 in 2015, the W3C creates new recommendations based on snapshots of the WHATWG standard.
DOM Level 1 provided a complete model for an entire HTML or XML document, including the means to change any portion of the document.DOM Level 2 was published in late 2000. It introduced the getElementById function as well as an event model and support for XML namespaces and CSS.DOM Level 3, published in April 2004, added support for XPath and keyboard event handling, as well as an interface for serializing documents as XML.DOM Level 4 was published in 2015. It is a snapshot of the WHATWG living standard.[7]Applications[edit]Web browsers[edit]To render a document such as a HTML page, most web browsers use an internal model similar to the DOM. The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree, with the topmost node named as ""Document object"". When an HTML page is rendered in browsers, the browser downloads the HTML into local memory and automatically parses it to display the page on screen.[8]JavaScript[edit]When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page, which is an object oriented representation of an HTML document that acts as an interface between JavaScript and the document itself. This allows the creation of dynamic web pages,[9] because within a page JavaScript can:
add, change, and remove any of the HTML elements and attributeschange any of the CSS stylesreact to all the existing eventscreate new eventsImplementations[edit]Because the DOM supports navigation in any direction (e.g., parent and previous sibling) and allows for arbitrary modifications, an implementation must at least buffer the document that has been read so far (or some parsed form of it).[10]Layout engines[edit]See also: Comparison of JavaScript engines (DOM support)Web browsers rely on layout engines to parse HTML into a DOM. Some layout engines, such as Trident/MSHTML, are associated primarily or exclusively with a particular browser, such as Internet Explorer. Others, including Blink, WebKit, and Gecko, are shared by a number of browsers, such as Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Firefox. The different layout engines implement the DOM standards to varying degrees of compliance.

Please help improve the article by merging similar sections and removing unneeded subheaders.  (February 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Software upgrade versioning is the process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of computer software. Within a given version number category (major, minor), these numbers are generally assigned in increasing order and correspond to new developments in the software. At a fine-grained level, revision control is often used for keeping track of incrementally different versions of information, whether or not this information is computer software.
Modern computer software is often tracked using two different software versioning schemes—internal version number that may be incremented many times in a single day, such as a revision control number, and a release version that typically changes far less often, such as semantic versioning[1] or a project code name.

Schemes[edit]A variety of version numbering schemes have been created to keep track of different versions of a piece of software. The ubiquity of computers has also led to these schemes being used in contexts outside computing.
Sequence-based identifiers[edit]In sequence-based software versioning schemes, each software release is assigned a unique identifier that consists of one or more sequences of numbers or letters. This is the extent of the commonality; schemes vary widely in areas such as the quantity of sequences, the attribution of meaning to individual sequences, and the means of incrementing the sequences.
Change significanceIn some schemes, sequence-based identifiers are used to convey the significance of changes between releases. Changes are classified by significance level, and the decision of which sequence to change between releases is based on the significance of the changes from the previous release, whereby the first sequence is changed for the most significant changes, and changes to sequences after the first represent changes of decreasing significance.
Depending on the scheme, significance may be assessed by lines of code changed, function points added or removed, potential impact on customers in terms of work required to adopt a newer version, risk of bugs or undeclared breaking changes, degree of changes in visual layout, quantity of new features, or almost anything the product developers or marketers deem to be significant, including marketing desire to stress the ""relative goodness"" of the new version.
Semantic versioning (aka SemVer),[1] is a widely adopted version scheme[2] that uses a sequence of three digits (Major.Minor.Patch), an optional pre-release tag and optional build meta tag. In this scheme, risk and functionality are the measures of significance. Breaking changes are indicated by increasing the major number (high risk), new non-breaking features increment the minor number (medium risk) and all other non-breaking changes increment the patch number (lowest risk). The presence of a pre-release tag (-alpha, -beta) indicates substantial risk, as does a major number of zero (0.y.z), which is used to indicate a work-in-progress that may contain any level of potentially breaking changes (highest risk).
Developers may choose to jump multiple minor versions at a time to indicate significant features have been added, but are not enough to warrant incrementing a major version number; for example Internet Explorer 5 from 5.1 to 5.5, or Adobe Photoshop 5 to 5.5. This may be done to emphasize the value of the upgrade to the software user, or, as in Adobe's case, to represent a release halfway between major versions (although levels of sequence based versioning are not limited to a single digit, as in Blender version 2.79).
A different approach is to use the major and minor numbers, along with an alphanumeric string denoting the release type, e.g. ""alpha"" (a), ""beta"" (b), or ""release candidate"" (rc). A software release train using this approach might look like 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 → 1.0b1, 1.0b2 (with some fixes), 1.0b3 (with more fixes) → 1.0rc1 (which, if it is stable enough), 1.0rc2 (if more bugs are found) → 1.0. It is a common practice in this scheme to lock-out new features and breaking changes during the release candidate phases and for some teams, even betas are lock-down to bug fixes only, in order to ensure convergence on the target release.
Other schemes impart meaning on individual sequences:
major.minor[.build[.revision]]  (example: 1.2.12.102)major.minor[.maintenance[.build]]  (example: 1.4.3.5249)Again, in these examples, the definition of what constitutes a ""major"" as opposed to a ""minor"" change is entirely subjective and up to the author, as is what defines a ""build"", or how a ""revision"" differs from a ""minor"" change.
Shared libraries in Solaris and Linux may use the current.revision.age format where:[3][4]current: The most recent interface number that the library implements.revision: The implementation number of the current interface.age: The difference between the newest and oldest interfaces that the library implements. This use of the third field is specific to libtool: others may use a different meaning or simply ignore it.A similar problem of relative change significance and versioning nomenclature exists in book publishing, where edition numbers or names can be chosen based on varying criteria.
In most proprietary software, the first released version of a software product has version 1.[according to whom?]Degree of compatibility  Semantic versioning three-part version numberSome projects use the major version number to indicate incompatible releases. Two examples are Apache Portable Runtime (APR)[5] and the FarCry CMS.[6]Semantic versioning[1] is a formal convention for specifying compatibility using a three-part version number: major version; minor version; and patch. The patch number is incremented for minor changes and bug fixes which do not change the software's application programming interface (API). The minor version is incremented for releases which add new, but backward-compatible, API features, and the major version is incremented for API changes which are not backward-compatible. For example, software which relies on version 2.1.5 of an API is compatible with version 2.2.3, but not necessarily with 3.2.4.
Often programmers write new software to be backward compatible, i.e., the new software is designed to interact correctly with older versions of the software (using old protocols and file formats) and the most recent version (using the latest protocols and file formats). For example, IBM z/OS is designed to work properly with 3 consecutive major versions of the operating system running in the same sysplex.
This enables people who run a high availability computer cluster to keep most of the computers up and running while one machine at a time is shut down, upgraded, and restored to service.[7]Often packet headers and file format include a version number – sometimes the same as the version number of the software that wrote it; other times a ""protocol version number"" independent of the software version number.
The code to handle old deprecated protocols and file formats is often seen as cruft.
Designating development stageSoftware in the experimental stage (alpha or beta) often use a zero in the first (""major"") position of the sequence to designate its status. However, this scheme is only useful for the early stages, not for upcoming releases with established software where the version number has already progressed past 0.[1]A number of schemes are used to denote the status of a newer release:
Alphanumeric suffix is a common scheme adopted by semantic versioning.[1] In this scheme, versions are affixed a dash plus some alphanumeric characters to indicate the status.Numeric status is a scheme that uses numbers to indicate the status as if it's part of the sequence. A typical choice is the third position for the four-position versioning.Numeric 90+ is another scheme that uses numbers, but apparently under a number of a previous version. A large number in the last position, typically 90 or higher, is used. This is commonly used by older open source projects like GNOME and Fontconfig.Comparison of development stage indicators
StageSemverNum. StatusNum 90+
Alpha1.2.0-a.11.2.0.11.1.90
Beta1.2.0-b.21.2.1.21.1.93
Release candidate1.2.0-rc.31.2.2.31.1.97
Release1.2.01.2.3.01.2.0
Post-release fixes1.2.51.2.3.51.2.5
The two purely numeric forms removes the special logic required to handle the comparison of ""alpha < beta < rc < no prefix"" as found in semantic versioning, at the cost of clarity. (semantic versioning actually does not specify specific terms for development stages; the comparison is simply in lexicographical order.)
Incrementing sequencesThere are two schools of thought regarding how numeric version numbers are incremented. Most free and open-source software packages, including MediaWiki, treat versions as a series of individual numbers, separated by periods, with a progression such as 1.7.0, 1.8.0, 1.8.1, 1.9.0, 1.10.0, 1.11.0, 1.11.1, 1.11.2, and so on.
On the other hand, some software packages identify releases by decimal numbers: 1.7, 1.8, 1.81, 1.82, 1.9, etc. Decimal versions were common in the 1980s, for example with NetWare, DOS, and Microsoft Windows, but even in the 2000s have been for example used by Opera[8] and Movable Type.[9] In the decimal scheme, 1.81 is the minor version following 1.8, while maintenance releases (i.e. bug fixes only) may be denoted with an alphabetic suffix, such as 1.81a or 1.81b.
The standard GNU version numbering scheme is major.minor.revision,[10] but Emacs is a notable example using another scheme where the major number (1) was dropped and a user site revision was added which is always zero in original Emacs packages but increased by distributors.[11] Similarly, Debian package numbers are prefixed with an optional ""epoch"", which is used to allow the versioning scheme to be changed.[12]ResettingIn some cases, developers may decide to reset the major version number. This is sometimes used to denote a new development phase being released. For example, Minecraft Alpha ran from version 1.0.0 to 1.2.6, and when Beta was released, it reset the major version number, and ran from 1.0 to 1.8. Once the game was fully released, the major version number again reset to 1.0.0.[13]Separating sequencesWhen printed, the sequences may be separated with characters. The choice of characters and their usage varies by scheme. The following list shows hypothetical examples of separation schemes for the same release (the thirteenth third-level revision to the fourth second-level revision to the second first-level revision):[original research?]A scheme may use the same character between all sequences: 2.4.13, 2/4/13, 2-4-13A scheme choice of which sequences to separate may be inconsistent, separating some sequences but not others: 2.413A scheme's choice of characters may be inconsistent within the same identifier: 2.4_13When a period is used to separate sequences, it may or may not represent a decimal point, — see “Incrementing sequences” section for various interpretation styles.
Number of sequencesThere is sometimes a fourth, unpublished number which denotes the software build (as used by Microsoft). Adobe Flash is a notable case where a four-part version number is indicated publicly, as in 10.1.53.64. Some companies also include the build date. Version numbers may also include letters and other characters, such as Lotus 1-2-3 Release 1a.
Using negative numberSome projects use negative version numbers. One example is the SmartEiffel compiler which started from -1.0 and counted upwards to 0.0.[11]Date of release[edit]  Street Fighter EXsplash screen showing release number in CalVer formatMany projects use a date-based versioning scheme called Calendar Versioning (aka CalVer[14]).
Ubuntu Linux is one example of a project using calendar versioning; Ubuntu 18.04, for example, was released April 2018. This has the advantage of being easily relatable to development schedules and support timelines. Some video games also use date as versioning, for example the arcade gameStreet Fighter EX. At startup it displays the version number as a date plus a region code, for example 961219 ASIA.[citation needed]When using dates in versioning, for instance, file names, it is common to use the ISO 8601 scheme:[15] YYYY-MM-DD, as this is easily string sorted to increasing/decreasing order. The hyphens are sometimes omitted. The Wine project formerly used a date versioning scheme, which used the year followed by the month followed by the day of the release; for example, ""Wine 20040505"".[citation needed]Microsoft Office build numbers are an encoded date:[16] the first two digits indicate the number of months that have passed from the January of the year in which the project started (with each major Office release being a different project), while the last two digits indicate the day of that month. So 3419 is the 19th day of the 34th month after the month of January of the year the project started.[citation needed]Other examples that identify versions by year include Adobe Illustrator 88 and WordPerfect Office 2003. When a date is used to denote version, it is generally for marketing purposes, and an actual version number also exists. For example, Microsoft Windows 95 is internally versioned as MS-DOS 7.00 and Windows 4.00; likewise, Microsoft Windows 2000 Server is internally versioned as Windows NT 5.0 (""NT"" being a reference to the original product name).[original research?]Python[edit]The Python Software Foundation has published PEP 440 -- Version Identification and Dependency Specification,[17] outlining their own flexible scheme, that defines an epoch segment, a release segment, pre-release and post-release segments and a development release segment.
TeX[edit]TeX has an idiosyncratic version numbering system. Since version 3, updates have been indicated by adding an extra digit at the end, so that the version number asymptotically approaches π; this is a form of unary numbering – the version number is the number of digits. The current version is 3.14159265. This is a reflection of TeX being very stable, and only minor updates are anticipated. TeX developer Donald Knuth has stated that the ""absolutely final change (to be made after [his] death)"" will be to change the version number to π, at which point all remaining bugs will become permanent features.[18]In a similar way, the version number of METAFONT asymptotically approaches e.
Apple[edit]During the era of the classic Mac OS, minor version numbers rarely went beyond "".1"". When they did, they usually jumped straight to "".5"", suggesting the release was ""more significant"".[a] Thus, ""8.5"" was marketed as its own release, representing ""Mac OS 8 and a half"", and 8.6 effectively meant ""8.5.1"".
Mac OS X departed from this trend, in large part because ""X"" (the Roman numeral for 10) was in the name of the product. As a result, all versions of |OS X began with the number 10. The first major release of OS X was given the version number 10.0, but the next major release was not 11.0. Instead, it was numbered 10.1, followed by 10.2, 10.3, and so on for each subsequent major release. Thus the 11th major version of OS X was labeled ""10.10"". Even though the ""X"" was dropped from the name as of macOS 10.12, this numbering scheme continued through macOS 10.15. Under the ""X""-based versioning scheme, the third number (instead of the second) denoted a minor release, and additional updates below this level, as well as updates to a given major version of OS X coming after the release of a new major version, were titled Supplemental Updates.[19]The Roman numeral X was concurrently leveraged for marketing purposes across multiple product lines. Both QuickTime and Final Cut Pro jumped from version 7 directly to version 10, QuickTime X and Final Cut Pro X. Like Mac OS X itself, the products were not upgrades to previous versions, but brand-new programs. As with OS X, major releases for these programs incremented the second digit and minor releases were denoted using a third digit. The ""X"" was dropped from Final Cut's name with the release of macOS 11.0 (see below), and QuickTime's branding became moot when the framework was deprecated in favor of AVFoundation in 2011 (the program for playing QuickTime video was only named QuickTime Player from the start).
Apple's next macOS release, provisionally numbered 10.16,[20] was officially announced as macOS 11.0 at WWDC in June 2020.[21]Microsoft Windows[edit]The Microsoft Windows operating system was first labelled with standard version numbers for Windows 1.0 through Windows 3.11. After this Microsoft excluded the version number from the product name. For Windows 95 (version 4.0), Windows 98 (4.10) and Windows 2000 (5.0), year of the release was included in the product title. After Windows 2000, Microsoft created the Windows Server family which continued the year-based style with a difference: For minor releases, Microsoft suffixed ""R2"" to the title, e.g., Windows Server 2008 R2 (version 6.1). This style had remained consistent to this date. The client versions of Windows however did not adopt a consistent style. First, they received names with arbitrary alphanumeric suffixes as with Windows ME (4.90), Windows XP (5.1) and Windows Vista (6.0). Then, once again Microsoft adopted incremental numbers in the title, but this time, they were not version numbers; the version numbers of Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 are respectively 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3. In Windows 10, the version number leaped to 10.0[22] and subsequent updates to the OS only incremented build number and update build revision (UBR) number.
Other schemes[edit]Some software producers use different schemes to denote releases of their software. The Debian project uses a major/minor versioning scheme for releases of its operating system, but uses code names from the movie Toy Story during development to refer to stable, unstable and testing releases.[23]BLAG Linux and GNU features very large version numbers: major releases have numbers such as 50000 and 60000, while minor releases increase the number by 1 (e.g. 50001, 50002). Alpha and beta releases are given decimal version numbers slightly less than the major release number, such as 19999.00071 for alpha 1 of version 20000, and 29999.50000 for beta 2 of version 30000. Starting at 9001 in 2003, the most recent version as of 2011[update] is 140000.[24][25][26]Internal version numbers[edit]Software may have an ""internal"" version number which differs from the version number shown in the product name (and which typically follows version numbering rules more consistently). Java SE 5.0, for example, has the internal version number of 1.5.0, and versions of Windows from NT 4 on have continued the standard numerical versions internally: Windows 2000 is NT 5.0, XP is Windows NT 5.1, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition are NT 5.2, Windows Server 2008 and Vista are NT 6.0, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 are NT 6.1, Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 are NT 6.2, and Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1 are NT 6.3, however the first version of Windows 10 was 10.0 (10.0.10240). Note, however, that Windows NT is only on its fifth major revision, as its first release was numbered 3.1 (to match the then-current Windows release number) and the Windows 10 launching made a version leap from 6.3 to 10.0.
Pre-release versions[edit]In conjunction with the various versioning schemes listed above, a system for denoting pre-release versions is generally used, as the program makes its way through the stages of the software release life cycle.
Programs that are in an early stage are often called ""alpha"" software, after the first letter in the Greek alphabet. After they mature but are not yet ready for release, they may be called ""beta"" software, after the second letter in the Greek alphabet. Generally alpha software is tested by developers only, while beta software is distributed for community testing.
Some systems use numerical versions less than 1 (such as 0.9), to suggest their approach toward a final ""1.0"" release. This is a common convention in open source software.[27][28] However, if the pre-release version is for an existing software package (e.g. version 2.5), then an ""a"" or ""alpha"" may be appended to the version number. So the alpha version of the 2.5 release might be identified as 2.5a or 2.5.a.
An alternative is to refer to pre-release versions as ""release candidates"", so that software packages which are soon to be released as a particular version may carry that version tag followed by ""rc-#"", indicating the number of the release candidate; when the final version is released, the ""rc"" tag is removed.
Release train[edit]A software release train is a form of software release schedule in which a number of distinct series of versioned software releases for multiple products are released as a number of different ""trains"" on a regular schedule. Generally, for each product line, a number of different release trains are running at a given time, with each train moving from initial release to eventual maturity and retirement on a planned schedule. Users may experiment with a newer release train before adopting it for production, allowing them to experiment with newer, ""raw"", releases early, while continuing to follow the previous train's point releases for their production systems prior to moving to the new release train as it becomes mature.
Cisco's IOS software platform used a release train schedule with many distinct trains for many years. More recently, a number of other platforms including Firefox and Fenix for Android,[29]Eclipse,[30]LibreOffice,[31]Ubuntu,[32] Fedora,[33] Python,[34] digiKam[35] and VMware[36] have adopted the release train model.
Modifications to the numeric system[edit]Odd-numbered versions for development releases[edit]Between the 1.0 and the 2.6.x series, the Linux kernel used odd minor version numbers to denote development releases and even minor version numbers to denote stable releases; see Linux kernel § Version numbering. For example, Linux 2.3 was a development family of the second major design of the Linux kernel, and Linux 2.4 was the stable release family that Linux 2.3 matured into. After the minor version number in the Linux kernel is the release number, in ascending order; for example, Linux 2.4.0 → Linux 2.4.22. Since the 2004 release of the 2.6 kernel, Linux no longer uses this system, and has a much shorter release cycle.
The same odd-even system is used by some other software with long release cycles, such as Node.js up to version 0.12 as well as GNOME and WineHQ.[37]Political and cultural significance of version numbers[edit]Version 1.0 as a milestone[edit]The free-software and open source communities tend to release software early and often. Initial versions are numbers less than 1, with these 0.x version used to convey that the software is incomplete and not reliable enough for general release or usable in its current state. 
Version 1.0 is used as a major milestone, indicating that the software has at least all major features plus functions the developers wanted to get into that version, and is considered reliable enough for general release.[27][28] A good example of this is the Linux kernel, which was first released as version 0.01 in 1991,[38] and took until 1994 to reach version 1.0.0.[39]The developers of the arcade game emulator MAME do not ever intend to release a version 1.0 of the program because there will always be more arcade games to emulate and thus the project can never be truly completed. Accordingly, version 0.99 was followed by version 0.100.[40]Since the internet has become widespread most commercial software vendors do no longer follow this maxim that a major version should be ""complete"" and instead rely on patches with bugfixes to sort out the known issues which a solution has been found for and could be fixed.
Some software vendors even goes as far as requiring so-called ""day-one-patches"" to be applied before the software will work as it should or release new features and functions via DLC (Downloadable Content), sometimes including basic core features and functions which sometimes can be argued that they should have been included the initial ""Version 1.0"" release.
Version numbers as marketing[edit]A relatively common practice is to make major jumps in version numbers for marketing reasons. Sometimes software vendors sometimes just bypass the 1.0 release or quickly release a release with a subsequent version number because 1.0 software is considered by many customers too immature to trust with production deployments.[citation needed] For example, as in the case of dBase II, a product is launched with a version number that implies that it is more mature than it is;
Other times version numbers are increased to match those of competitors. This can be seen in many examples of product version numbering by Microsoft, America Online, Sun Solaris, Java Virtual Machine, SCO Unix, WordPerfect. Microsoft Access jumped from version 2.0 to version 7.0, to match the version number of Microsoft Word.
Microsoft has also been the target of 'catch-up' versioning, with the Netscape browsers skipping version 5 to 6, in line with Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but also because the Mozilla application suite inherited version 5 in its user agent string during pre-1.0 development and Netscape 6.x was built upon Mozilla's code base.
Another example of keeping up with competitors is when Slackware Linux jumped from version 4 to version 7 in 1999.[41]Dropping the most significant element[edit]Sun's Java has at times had a hybrid system, where the internal version number has always been 1.x but has been marketed by reference only to the x:
JDK 1.0.3JDK 1.1.2 through 1.1.8J2SE 1.2.0 (""Java 2"") through 1.4.2Java 1.5.0, 1.6.0, 1.7.0, 1.8.0 (""Java 5, 6, 7, 8"")Sun also dropped the first digit for Solaris, where Solaris 2.8 (or 2.9) is referred to as Solaris 8 (or 9) in marketing materials.
A similar jump took place with the Asterisk open-source PBX construction kit in the early 2010s, whose project leads announced that the current version 1.8.x would soon be followed by version 10.[42]This approach, panned by many[according to whom?] because it breaks the semantic significance of the sections of the version number, has been adopted by an increasing number of vendors including Mozilla (for Firefox).[citation needed]Superstition[edit]The Office 2007 release of Microsoft Office had an internal version number of 12. The next version, Office 2010, has an internal version of 14, due to superstitions surrounding the number 13.[43] Visual Studio 2013 is Version number 12.0 of the product, and the new version, Visual Studio 2015 has the Version number 14.0 for the same reasons.[44][circular reference]Roxio Toast went from version 12 to version 14, likely in an effort to skip the superstitions surrounding the number 13.Corel's WordPerfect Office, version 13 is marketed as ""X3"" (Roman number 10 and ""3""). The procedure has continued into the next version, X4. The same has happened with Corel's Graphic Suite (i.e. CorelDRAW, Corel Photo-Paint) as well as its video editing software ""Video Studio"".[citation needed]Sybase skipped major versions 13 and 14 in its Adaptive Server Enterprise relational database product, moving from 12.5 to 15.0.[citation needed]ABBYY Lingvo Dictionary uses numbering 12, x3 (14), x5 (15).[citation needed]SUSE Linux Enterprise skipped version 13 and 14 after version 12 and directly released SLES 15 in July 2018.[citation needed]Geek culture[edit]The SUSE Linux distribution started at version 4.2,[citation needed] to reference 42, ""the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything"" mentioned in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.A Slackware Linux distribution was versioned 13.37, referencing leet.Finnix skipped from version 93.0 to 100, partly to fulfill the assertion, ""There Will Be No Finnix '95"", a reference to Windows 95.[45]The Tagged Image File Format specification has used 42 as internal version number since its inception,[when?] its designers not expecting to alter it anymore during their (or its) lifetime since it would conflict[according to whom?] with its development directives.Overcoming perceived marketing difficulties[edit]In the mid-1990s, the rapidly growing CMMS, Maximo, moved from Maximo Series 3 directly to Series 5, skipping Series 4 due to that number's perceived marketing difficulties in the Chinese market, where the number 4 is associated with ""death"" (see tetraphobia). This did not, however, stop Maximo Series 5 version 4.0 being released. (The ""Series"" versioning has since been dropped, effectively resetting version numbers after Series 5 version 1.0's release.)
Significance in software engineering[edit]Version numbers are used in practical terms by the consumer, or client, to identify or compare their copy of the software product against another copy, such as the newest version released by the developer. For the programmer or company, versioning is often used on a revision-by-revision basis, where individual parts of the software are compared and contrasted with newer or older revisions of those same parts, often in a collaborative version control system.
In the 21st century, more programmers started to use a formalized version policy, such as the semantic versioning policy.[1] The purpose of such policies is to make it easier for other programmers to know when code changes are likely to break things they have written. Such policies are especially important for software libraries and frameworks, but may also be very useful to follow for command-line applications (which may be called from other applications) and indeed any other applications (which may be scripted and/or extended by third parties).
Versioning is also a required practice to enable many schemes of patching and upgrading software, especially to automatically decide what and where to upgrade to.
Significance in technical support[edit]Version numbers allow people providing support to ascertain exactly which code a user is running, so that they can rule out bugs that have already been fixed as a cause of an issue, and the like. This is especially important when a program has a substantial user community, especially when that community is large enough that the people providing technical support are not the people who wrote the code. The semantic meaning[1] of version.revision.change style numbering is also important to information technology staff, who often use it to determine how much attention and research they need to pay to a new release before deploying it in their facility. As a rule of thumb, the bigger the changes, the larger the chances that something might break (although examining the Changelog, if any, may reveal only superficial or irrelevant changes). This is one reason for some of the distaste expressed in the ""drop the major release"" approach taken by Asterisk et alia: now, staff must (or at least should) do a full regression test for every update.
Version numbers for files and documents[edit]Some computer file systems, such as the OpenVMS Filesystem, also keep versions for files.
Versioning amongst documents is relatively similar to the routine used with computers and software engineering, where with each small change in the structure, contents, or conditions, the version number is incremented by 1, or a smaller or larger value, again depending on the personal preference of the author and the size or importance of changes made.
Version number ordering systems[edit]Version numbers very quickly evolve from simple integers (1, 2, ...) to rational numbers (2.08, 2.09, 2.10)
and then to non-numeric ""numbers"" such as 4:3.4.3-2. These complex version numbers are therefore better treated as character strings. Operating systems that include package management facilities (such as all non-trivial Linux or BSD distributions) will use a distribution-specific algorithm for comparing version numbers of different software packages. For example, the ordering algorithms of Red Hat and derived distributions differ to those of the Debian-like distributions.
As an example of surprising version number ordering implementation behavior, in Debian, leading zeroes are ignored in chunks, so that 5.0005 and 5.5 are considered as equal, and 5.5 < 5.0006. This can confuse users; string-matching tools may fail to find a given version number; and this can cause subtle bugs in package management if the programmers use string-indexed data structures such as version-number indexed hash tables.
In order to ease sorting, some software packages represent each component of the major.minor.release scheme with a fixed width. Perl represents its version numbers as a floating-point number; for example, Perl's 5.8.7 release can also be represented as 5.008007. This allows a theoretical version of 5.8.10 to be represented as 5.008010. Other software packages pack each segment into a fixed bit width; for example, on Microsoft Windows, version number 6.3.9600.16384 would be represented as hexadecimal 0x0006000325804000. The floating-point scheme breaks down if any segment of the version number exceeds 999; a packed-binary scheme employing 16 bits apiece breaks down after 65535.
Use in other media[edit]Software-style version numbers can be found in other media.
In some cases, the use is a direct analogy (for example: Jackass 2.5, a version of Jackass Number Two with additional special features; the second album by Garbage, titled Version 2.0; or Dungeons & Dragons 3.5, where the rules were revised from the third edition, but not so much as to be considered the fourth).
More often it's used to play on an association with high technology, and doesn't literally indicate a 'version' (e.g., Tron 2.0, a video game followup to the film Tron, or the television series The IT Crowd, which refers to the second season as Version 2.0). A particularly notable usage is Web 2.0, referring to websites from the early 2000s that emphasized user-generated content, usability and interoperability.

A module interface expresses the elements that are provided and required by the module. The elements defined in the interface are detectable by other modules. The implementation contains the working code that corresponds to the elements declared in the interface. Modular programming is closely related to structured programming and object-oriented programming, all having the same goal of facilitating construction of large software programs and systems by decomposition into smaller pieces, and all originating around the 1960s. While the historical usage of these terms has been inconsistent, ""modular programming"" now refers to the high-level decomposition of the code of an entire program into pieces: structured programming to the low-level code use of structured control flow, and object-oriented programming to the data use of objects, a kind of data structure.
In object-oriented programming, the use of interfaces as an architectural pattern to construct modules is known as interface-based programming[citation needed].

Terminology[edit]The term assembly (as in .NET languages like C#, F# or Visual Basic .NET) or package (as in Dart, Go or Java) is sometimes used instead of module. In other implementations, these are distinct concepts; in Python a package is a collection of modules, while in Java 9 the introduction of the new module concept (a collection of packages with enhanced access control) is planned.
Furthermore, the term ""package"" has other uses in software (for example .NET NuGet packages). A component is a similar concept, but typically refers to a higher level; a component is a piece of a whole system, while a module is a piece of an individual program. The scale of the term ""module"" varies significantly between languages; in Python it is very small-scale and each file is a module, while in Java 9 it is planned to be large-scale, where a module is a collection of packages, which are in turn collections of files.
Other terms for modules include unit, used in Pascal dialects.
Language support[edit]Languages that formally support the module concept include Ada, Algol, BlitzMax, C++, C#, Clojure, COBOL, Common_Lisp, D, Dart, eC, Erlang, Elixir, Elm, F, F#, Fortran, Go, Haskell, IBM/360Assembler, IBM i Control Language (CL), IBM RPG, Java,[a]MATLAB, ML, Modula, Modula-2, Modula-3, Morpho, NEWP, Oberon, Oberon-2, Objective-C, OCaml, several derivatives of Pascal (Component Pascal, Object Pascal, Turbo Pascal, UCSD Pascal), Perl, PL/I, PureBasic, Python, Ruby,[2]Rust, JavaScript,[3]Visual Basic .NET and WebDNA.
Conspicuous examples of languages that lack support for modules are C and have been C++ and Pascal in their original form, C and C++ do, however, allow separate compilation and declarative interfaces to be specified using header files. Modules were added to Objective-C in iOS 7 (2013); to C++ with C++20,[4] and Pascal was superseded by Modula and Oberon, which included modules from the start, and various derivatives that included modules. JavaScript has had native modules since ECMAScript 2015.
Modular programming can be performed even where the programming language lacks explicit syntactic features to support named modules, like, for example, in C. This is done by using existing language features, together with, for example, coding conventions, programming idioms and the physical code structure. The IBM System i also uses modules when programming in the Integrated Language Environment (ILE).
Key aspects[edit]With modular programming, concerns are separated such that modules perform logically discrete functions, interacting through well-defined interfaces. Often modules form a directed acyclic graph (DAG); in this case a cyclic dependency between modules is seen as indicating that these should be a single module. In the case where modules do form a DAG they can be arranged as a hierarchy, where the lowest-level modules are independent, depending on no other modules, and higher-level modules depend on lower-level ones. A particular program or library is a top-level module of its own hierarchy, but can in turn be seen as a lower-level module of a higher-level program, library, or system.
When creating a modular system, instead of creating a monolithic application (where the smallest component is the whole), several smaller modules are written separately so when they are composed together, they construct the executable application program. Typically these are also compiled separately, via separate compilation, and then linked by a linker. A just-in-time compiler may perform some of this construction ""on-the-fly"" at run time.
These independent functions are commonly classified as either program control functions or specific task functions. Program control functions are designed to work for one program. Specific task functions are closely prepared to be applicable for various programs. 
This makes modular designed systems, if built correctly, far more reusable than a traditional monolithic design, since all (or many) of these modules may then be reused (without change) in other projects. This also facilitates the ""breaking down"" of projects into several smaller projects. Theoretically, a modularized software project will be more easily assembled by large teams, since no team members are creating the whole system, or even need to know about the system as a whole. They can focus just on the assigned smaller task (this, it is claimed, counters the key assumption of The Mythical Man Month, making it actually possible to add more developers to a late software project without making it later still).
History[edit]Modular programming, in the form of subsystems (particularly for I/O) and software libraries, dates to early software systems, where it was used for code reuse. Modular programming per se, with a goal of modularity, developed in the late 1960s and 1970s, as a larger-scale analog of the concept of structured programming (1960s). The term ""modular programming"" dates at least to the National Symposium on Modular Programming, organized at the Information and Systems Institute in July 1968 by Larry Constantine; other key concepts were information hiding (1972) and separation of concerns (SoC, 1974).
Modules were not included in the original specification for ALGOL 68 (1968), but were included as extensions in early implementations, ALGOL 68-R (1970) and ALGOL 68C (1970), and later formalized.[5] One of the first languages designed from the start for modular programming was the short-lived Modula (1975), by Niklaus Wirth. Another early modular language was Mesa (1970s), by Xerox PARC, and Wirth drew on Mesa as well as the original Modula in its successor, Modula-2 (1978), which influenced later languages, particularly through its successor, Modula-3 (1980s). Modula's use of dot-qualified names, like M.a to refer to object a from module M, coincides with notation to access a field of a record (and similarly for attributes or methods of objects), and is now widespread, seen in C#, Dart, Go, Java, and Python, among others. Modular programming became widespread from the 1980s: the original Pascal language (1970) did not include modules, but later versions, notably UCSD Pascal (1978) and Turbo Pascal (1983) included them in the form of ""units"", as did the Pascal-influenced Ada (1980). The Extended Pascal ISO 10206:1990 standard kept closer to Modula2 in its modular support. Standard ML (1984)[6] has one of the most complete module systems, including functors (parameterized modules) to map between modules.
In the 1980s and 1990s, modular programming was overshadowed by and often conflated with object-oriented programming, particularly due to the popularity of C++ and Java. For example, the C family of languages had support for objects and classes in C++ (originally C with Classes, 1980) and Objective-C (1983), only supporting modules 30 years or more later. Java (1995) supports modules in the form of packages, though the primary unit of code organization is a class. However, Python (1991) prominently used both modules and objects from the start, using modules as the primary unit of code organization and ""packages"" as a larger-scale unit; and Perl 5 (1994) includes support for both modules and objects, with a vast array of modules being available from CPAN (1993).
Modular programming is now widespread, and found in virtually all major languages developed since the 1990s. The relative importance of modules varies between languages, and in class-based object-oriented languages there is still overlap and confusion with classes as a unit of organization and encapsulation, but these are both well-established as distinct concepts.

"12 October 2020, at 10:57","This article is about polymorphic type systems in computer science. For the mathematical class of order-types of a given cardinality, see Glossary of set theory § T.Not to be confused with class (computer programming).In computer science, a type class is a type system construct that supports ad hoc polymorphism. This is achieved by adding constraints to type variables in parametrically polymorphic types. Such a constraint typically involves a type class T and a type variablea, and means that a can only be instantiated to a type whose members support the overloaded operations associated with T.
Type classes were first implemented in the Haskell programming language after first being proposed by Philip Wadler and Stephen Blott as an extension to ""eqtypes"" in Standard ML,[1][2] and were originally conceived as a way of implementing overloaded arithmetic and equality operators in a principled fashion.[3][4]
In contrast with the ""eqtypes"" of Standard ML, overloading the equality operator through the use of type classes in Haskell does not require extensive modification of the compiler frontend or the underlying type system.[5]Since their creation, many other applications of type classes have been discovered.

Overview[edit]Type classes are defined by specifying a set of function or constant names, together with their respective types, that must exist for every type that belongs to the class. In Haskell, types can be parameterized; a type class Eq intended to contain types that admit equality would be declared in the following way:
classEqawhere
  (==)::a->a->Bool
  (/=)::a->a->Boolwhere a is one instance of the type class Eq, and a defines the function signatures for 2 functions (the equality and inequality functions), which each take 2 arguments of type a and return a boolean.
The type variable a has kind
  
    
      
        ∗
      
    
    {\displaystyle *}
   (also known as Type in the latest GHC release),[6] meaning that the kind of Eq is
Eq::Type->ConstraintThe declaration may be read as stating a ""type a belongs to type class Eq if there are functions named (==), and (/=), of the appropriate types, defined on it."" A programmer could then define a function elem (which determines if an element is in a list) in the following way:
elem::Eqa=>a->[a]->Boolelemy[]     =Falseelemy(x:xs)=(x==y)||elemyxsThe function elem has the type a -> [a] -> Bool with the context Eq a, which constrains the types which a can range over to those a which belong to the Eq type class. (Note: Haskell  =>  can be called a 'class constraint'.)
A programmer can make any type t a member of a given type class C by using an instance declaration that defines implementations of all of C's methods for the particular type t.  For instance, if a programmer defines a new data type t, they may then make this new type an instance of Eq by providing an equality function over values of type t in whatever way they see fit.  Once they have done this, they may use the function elem on [t], that is, lists of elements of type t.
Note that type classes are different from classes in object-oriented programming languages. In particular, Eq is not a type: there is no such thing as a value of type Eq.
Type classes are closely related to parametric polymorphism. For example, note that the type of elem as specified above would be the parametrically polymorphic type a -> [a] -> Bool were it not for the type class constraint ""Eq a =>"".
Higher-kinded polymorphism[edit]A type class need not take a type variable of kindType but can take one of any kind. These type classes with higher kinds are sometimes called constructor classes (the constructors referred to are type constructors such as Maybe, rather than data constructors such as Just). An example is the Monad class:
classMonadmwhere
  return::a->ma
  (>>=)  ::ma->(a->mb)->mbThe fact that m is applied to a type variable indicates that it has kind Type -> Type, i.e. it takes a type and returns a type, the kind of Monad is thus:
Monad::(Type->Type)->ConstraintMulti-parameter type classes[edit]Type classes permit multiple type parameters, and so type classes can be seen as relations on types.[7] For example, in the GHC standard library, the class IArray expresses a general immutable array interface. In this class, the type class constraint IArray a e means that a is an array type that contains elements of type e. (This restriction on polymorphism is used to implement unboxed array types, for example.)
Like multimethods[citation needed], multi-parameter type classes support calling different implementations of a method depending on the types of multiple arguments, and indeed return types.  Multi-parameter type classes do not require searching for the method to call on every call at runtime;[8]:minute 25:12 rather the method to call is first compiled and stored in the dictionary of the type class instance, just as with single-parameter type classes.
Haskell code that uses multi-parameter type classes is not portable, as this feature is not part of the Haskell 98 standard. The popular Haskell implementations, GHC and Hugs, support multi-parameter type classes.
Functional dependencies[edit]In Haskell, type classes have been refined to allow the programmer to declare functional dependencies between type parameters—a concept inspired from relational database theory.[9][10] That is, the programmer can assert that a given assignment of some subset of the type parameters uniquely determines the remaining type parameters. For example, a general monadsm which carry a state parameter of type s satisfy the type class constraint Monad.State s m. In this constraint, there is a functional dependency m -> s. This means that for a given monad m of type class Monad.State, the state type accessible from m is uniquely determined. This aids the compiler in type inference, as well as aiding the programmer in type-directed programming.
Simon Peyton-Jones has objected to the introduction of functional dependencies in Haskell on grounds of complexity.[11]Type classes and implicit parameters[edit]This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.  (January 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Type classes and implicit parameters are very similar in nature, although not quite the same.  A polymorphic function with a type class constraint such as:
sum::Numa=>[a]->acan be intuitively treated as a function that implicitly accepts an instance of Num:
sum_::Num_a->[a]->aThe instance Num_ a is essentially a record that contains the instance definition of Num a.  (This is in fact how type classes are implemented under the hood by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.)
However, there is a crucial difference: implicit parameters are more flexible – you can pass different instances of Num Int.  In contrast, type classes enforce the so-called coherence property, which requires that there should only be one unique choice of instance for any given type.  The coherence property makes type classes somewhat antimodular, which is why orphan instances (instances that are defined in a module that neither contains the class nor the type of interest) are strongly discouraged.  On the other hand, coherence adds an additional level of safety to the language, providing the programmer a guarantee that two disjoint parts of the same code will share the same instance.[12]As an example, an ordered set (of type Set a) requires a total ordering on the elements (of type a) in order to function.  This can be evidenced by a constraint Ord a, which defines a comparison operator on the elements.  However, there can be numerous ways to impose a total order.  Since set algorithms are generally intolerant of changes in the ordering once a set has been constructed, passing an incompatible instance of Ord a to functions that operate on the set may lead to incorrect results (or crashes).  Thus, enforcing coherence of Ord a in this particular scenario is crucial.
Instances (or ""dictionaries"") in Scala type classes are just ordinary values in the language, rather than a completely separate kind of entity.[13][14] While these instances are by default supplied by finding appropriate instances in scope to be used as the implicit actual parameters for explicitly-declared implicit formal parameters, the fact that they are ordinary values means that they can be supplied explicitly, to resolve ambiguity.  As a result, Scala type classes do not satisfy the coherence property and are effectively a syntactic sugar for implicit parameters.
This is an example taken from the Cats [15] documentation:
// A type class to provide textual representationtraitShow[A]{
  defshow(f:A):String}

// A polymorphic function that works only when there is an implicit // instance of Show[A] availabledeflog[A](a:A)(implicits:Show[A])=println(s.show(a))

// An instance for StringimplicitvalstringShow=newShow[String]{
  defshow(s:String)=s}

// The parameter stringShow was inserted by the compiler.scala>log(""a string"")astringCoq (version 8.2 onwards) also supports type classes by inferring the appropriate instances.[16] Recent versions of Agda 2 also provide a similar feature, called ""instance arguments"".[17]Other approaches to operator overloading[edit]In Standard ML, the mechanism of ""equality types"" corresponds roughly to Haskell's built-in type class Eq, but all equality operators are derived automatically by the compiler.  The programmer's control of the process is limited to designating which type components in a structure are equality types and which type variables in a polymorphic type range over equality types.
SML's and OCaml's modules and functors can play a role similar to that of Haskell's type classes, the principal difference being the role of type inference, which makes type classes suitable for ad hoc polymorphism.[18]
The object oriented subset of OCaml is yet another approach which is somewhat comparable to the one of type classes.
Related notions[edit]An analogous notion for overloaded data (implemented in GHC) is that of type family.[19]In Clean typeclasses are similar to Haskell, but have a slightly different syntax.
Rust supports traits, which are a limited form of type classes with coherence.[20]Mercury has typeclasses, although they are not exactly the same as in Haskell.[further explanation needed]In Scala, type classes are a programming idiom which can be implemented with existing language features such as implicit parameters, not a separate language feature per se. Because of the way they are implemented in Scala, it is possible to explicitly specify which type class instance to use for a type at a particular place in the code, in case of ambiguity. However, this is not necessarily a benefit as ambiguous type class instances can be error-prone.
The proof assistant Coq has also supported type classes in recent versions. Unlike in ordinary programming languages, in Coq, any laws of a type class (such as the monad laws) that are stated within the type class definition, must be mathematically proved of each type class instance before using them.

"19 December 2020, at 01:09","Value indicating that a referenced dataset is invalid or doesn't existIn computing, a null pointer or null reference is a value saved for indicating that the pointer or reference does not refer to a valid object. Programs routinely use null pointers to represent conditions such as the end of a list of unknown length or the failure to perform some action; this use of null pointers can be compared to nullable types and to the Nothing value in an option type.
A null pointer should not be confused with an uninitialized pointer: a null pointer is guaranteed to compare unequal to any pointer that points to a valid object. However, depending on the language and implementation, an uninitialized pointer may not have any such guarantee. It might compare equal to other, valid pointers; or it might compare equal to null pointers. It might do both at different times; or the comparison might be undefined behaviour.

C[edit]In C, two null pointers of any type are guaranteed to compare equal.[1] The preprocessor macro NULL is defined as an implementation-defined null pointer constant,[2] which in C99 can be portably expressed as the integer value 0 converted to the type void* (pointer to void).[3] The C standard does not say that the null pointer is the same as the pointer to memory address 0, though that may be the case in practice. Dereferencing a null pointer is undefined behavior in C,[4] and a conforming implementation is allowed to assume that any pointer that is dereferenced is not null.
In practice, dereferencing a null pointer may result in an attempted read or write from memory that is not mapped, triggering a segmentation fault or memory access violation. This may manifest itself as a program crash, or be transformed into a software exception that can be caught by program code. There are, however, certain circumstances where this is not the case. For example, in x86real mode, the address 0000:0000 is readable and also usually writable, and dereferencing a pointer to that address is a perfectly valid but typically unwanted action that may lead to undefined but non-crashing behavior in the application. There are occasions when dereferencing the pointer to address zero is intentional and well-defined; for example, BIOS code written in C for 16-bit real-mode x86 devices may write the IDT at physical address 0 of the machine by dereferencing a null pointer for writing. It is also possible for the compiler to optimize away the null pointer dereference, avoiding a segmentation fault but causing other undesired behavior.
C++[edit]In C++, while the NULL macro was inherited from C, the integer literal for zero has been traditionally preferred to represent a null pointer constant.[5] However, C++11 has introduced the explicit null pointer constant nullptr to be used instead.
Other languages[edit]In some programming language environments (at least one proprietary Lisp implementation, for example),[citation needed] the value used as the null pointer (called nil in Lisp) may actually be a pointer to a block of internal data useful to the implementation (but not explicitly reachable from user programs), thus allowing the same register to be used as a useful constant and a quick way of accessing implementation internals.  This is known as the nil vector.
In languages with a tagged architecture, a possibly null pointer can be replaced with a tagged union which enforces explicit handling of the exceptional case; in fact, a possibly null pointer can be seen as a tagged pointer with a computed tag.
Programming languages use different literals for the null pointer. In Python, for example, a null value is called None. In Pascal and Swift, a null pointer is called nil. In Eiffel, it is called a void reference.
Null dereferencing[edit]Because a null pointer does not point to a meaningful object, an attempt to dereference (ie. access the data stored at that memory location) a null pointer usually (but not always) causes a run-time error or immediate program crash.
In C, dereferencing a null pointer is undefined behavior.[4] Many implementations cause such code to result in the program being halted with an access violation, because the null pointer representation is chosen to be an address that is never allocated by the system for storing objects.  However, this behavior is not universal. It's also not guaranteed, since compilers are permitted to optimize programs under the assumption that they're free of undefined behaviour.In Delphi and many other Pascal implementations, the constant nil represents a null pointer to the first address in memory which is also used to initialize managed variables. Dereferencing it raises an external OS exception which is being mapped onto a Pascal EAccessViolation exception instance if the System.SysUtils unit is linked in the uses clause.In Java, access to a null reference triggers a NullPointerException (NPE), which can be caught by error handling code, but the preferred practice is to ensure that such exceptions never occur.In .NET, access to null reference triggers a NullReferenceException to be thrown. Although catching these is generally considered bad practice, this exception type can be caught and handled by the program.In Objective-C, messages may be sent to a nil object (which is a null pointer) without causing the program to be interrupted; the message is simply ignored, and the return value (if any) is nil or 0, depending on the type.[6]Before the introduction of SMAP, a null pointer dereference bug could be exploited by mapping pagezero into the attacker's address space and hence causing the null pointer to point to that region. This could lead to code execution in some cases.[7]Mitigation[edit]There are techniques to facilitate debugging null pointer dereferences.[8][9] Bond et al.[8] suggest to modify the JVM in order to keep track of null propagation. The idea of the Casper system[9] is to use source code transformation in order to track this propagation, without modifying the JVM. In some cases, it is possible to automatically generate a patch to fix null pointer exceptions.[10]History[edit]In 2009 Tony Hoare (C.A.R. Hoare) stated[11]
that he invented the null reference in 1965 as part of the ALGOL W language. In that 2009 reference Hoare describes his invention as a ""billion-dollar mistake"":

It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language (ALGOL W). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.See also[edit]Memory debuggerZero pageReferences[edit]Citations[edit]^ISO/IEC 9899, clause 6.3.2.3, paragraph 4.^ISO/IEC 9899, clause 7.17, paragraph 3: NULL... which expands to an implementation-defined null pointer constant...^ISO/IEC 9899, clause 6.3.2.3, paragraph 3.^ abISO/IEC 9899, clause 6.5.3.2, paragraph 4, esp. footnote 87.^Stroustrup, Bjarne (March 2001).

"5 December 2020, at 01:30","In computer science, a tagged union, also called a variant, variant record, choice type, discriminated union, disjoint union, sum type or coproduct, is a data structure used to hold a value that could take on several different, but fixed, types. Only one of the types can be in use at any one time, and a tag field explicitly indicates which one is in use. It can be thought of as a type that has several ""cases"", each of which should be handled correctly when that type is manipulated. This is critical in defining recursive datatypes, in which some component of a value may have the same type as the value itself, for example in defining a type for representing trees, where it is necessary to distinguish multi-node subtrees and leafs. Like ordinary unions, tagged unions can save storage by overlapping storage areas for each type, since only one is in use at a time.

Description[edit]Tagged unions are most important in functional languages such as ML and Haskell, where they are called datatypes (see algebraic data type) and the compiler is able to verify that all cases of a tagged union are always handled, avoiding many types of errors. They can, however, be constructed in nearly any language, and are much safer than untagged unions, often simply called unions, which are similar but do not explicitly keep track of which member of the union is currently in use.
Tagged unions are often accompanied by the concept of a type constructor, which is similar but not the same as a constructor for a class. Type constructors produce a tagged union type, given the initial tag type and the corresponding type.
Mathematically, tagged unions correspond to disjoint or discriminated unions, usually written using +. Given an element of a disjoint union A + B,  it is possible to determine whether it came from A or B. If an element lies in both, there will be two effectively distinct copies of the value in A + B, one from A and one from B.
In type theory, a tagged union is called a sum type.  Sum types are the dual of product types.  Notations vary, but usually the sum type A + B comes with two introduction forms (injections) inj1: A → A + B and inj2: B → A + B.  The elimination form is case analysis, known as pattern matching in ML-style programming languages: if e has type A + B and e1 and e2 have type

  .  The sum type corresponds to intuitionisticlogical disjunction under the Curry–Howard correspondence.
An enumerated type can be seen as a degenerate case: a tagged union of unit types.  It corresponds to a set of nullary constructors and may be implemented as a simple tag variable, since it holds no additional data besides the value of the tag.
Many programming techniques and data structures, including rope, lazy evaluation, class hierarchy (see below), arbitrary-precision arithmetic, CDR coding, the indirection bit and other kinds of tagged pointers, etc. 
are usually implemented using some sort of tagged union.
A tagged union can be seen as the simplest kind of self-describingdata format.
The tag of the tagged union can be seen as the simplest kind of metadata.
Advantages and disadvantages[edit]The primary advantage of a tagged union over an untagged union is that all accesses are safe, and the compiler can even check that all cases are handled. Untagged unions depend on program logic to correctly identify the currently active field, which may result in strange behavior and hard-to-find bugs if that logic fails.
The primary advantage of a tagged union over a simple record containing a field for each type is that it saves storage by overlapping storage for all the types. Some implementations reserve enough storage for the largest type, while others dynamically adjust the size of a tagged union value as needed. When the value is immutable, it is simple to allocate just as much storage as is needed.
The main disadvantage of tagged unions is that the tag occupies space. Since there are usually a small number of alternatives, the tag can often be squeezed into 2 or 3 bits wherever space can be found, but sometimes even these bits are not available. In this case, a helpful alternative may be folded, computed or encoded tags, where the tag value is dynamically computed from the contents of the union field. Common examples of this are the use of reserved values, where, for example, a function returning a positive number may return -1 to indicate failure, and sentinel values, most often used in tagged pointers.
Sometimes, untagged unions are used to perform bit-level conversions between types, called reinterpret casts in C++. Tagged unions are not intended for this purpose; typically a new value is assigned whenever the tag is changed.
Many languages support, to some extent, a universal data type, which is a type that includes every value of every other type, and often a way is provided to test the actual type of a value of the universal type. These are sometimes referred to as variants. While universal data types are comparable to tagged unions in their formal definition, typical tagged unions include a relatively small number of cases, and these cases form different ways of expressing a single coherent concept, such as a data structure node or instruction. Also, there is an expectation that every possible case of a tagged union will be dealt with when it is used. The values of a universal data type are not related and there is no feasible way to deal with them all.
Like option types and exception handling, tagged unions are sometimes used to handle the occurrence of exceptional results.  Often these tags are folded into the type as ""reserved values"", and their occurrence is not consistently checked: this is a fairly common source of programming errors.  This use of tagged unions can be formalized as a monad with the following functions:

  Examples[edit]Say we wanted to build a binary tree of integers. In ML, we would do this by creating a datatype like this:
datatypetree=Leaf
              |Nodeof(int*tree*tree)This is a tagged union with two cases: one, the leaf, is used to terminate a path of the tree, and functions much like a null value would in imperative languages. The other branch holds a node, which contains an integer and a left and right subtree. Leaf and Node are the constructors, which enable us to actually produce a particular tree, such as:
Node(5,Node(1,Leaf,Leaf),Node(3,Leaf,Node(4,Leaf,Leaf)))which corresponds to this tree:
Now we can easily write a typesafe function that, say, counts the number of nodes in the tree:
funcountNodes(Leaf)=0
  |countNodes(Node(int,left,right))=
      1+countNodes(left)+countNodes(right)Timeline of language support[edit]1960s[edit]In ALGOL 68, tagged unions are called united modes, the tag is implicit, and the case construct is used to determine which field is tagged:
modenode = union (real, int, compl, string);Usage example for unioncase of node:
node n := ""1234"";
 
case n in
  (real r):   print((""real:"", r)),
  (int i):    print((""int:"", i)),
  (compl c):  print((""compl:"", c)),
  (string s): print((""string:"", s))
  out         print((""?:"", n))
esac1970s & 1980s[edit]Although primarily only functional languages such as ML and Haskell (from 1990s) give a central role to tagged unions and have the power to check that all cases are handled, other languages have support for tagged unions as well. However, in practice they can be less efficient in non-functional languages due to optimizations enabled by functional language compilers that can eliminate explicit tag checks and avoid explicit storage of tags.[citation needed]Pascal, Ada, and Modula-2 call them variant records (formally discriminated type in Ada), and require the tag field to be manually created and the tag values specified, as in this Pascal example:
typeshapeKind=(square,rectangle,circle);
     shape=record
                centerx:integer;
                centery:integer;
                casekind:shapeKindof
                   square:(side:integer);
                   rectangle:(length,height:integer);
                   circle:(radius:integer);
	      end;and this Ada equivalent:
typeShape_Kindis(Square,Rectangle,Circle);typeShape(Kind: Shape_Kind)isrecord
   Center_X:Integer;
   Center_Y:Integer;
   caseKindis
      whenSquare=>
         Side:Integer;
      whenRectangle=>
         Length,Height:Integer;
      whenCircle=>
         Radius:Integer;
   endcase;end record;

-- Any attempt to access a member whose existence depends-- on a particular value of the discriminant, while the-- discriminant is not the expected one, raises an error.In C and C++, a tagged union can be created from untagged unions using a strict access discipline where the tag is always checked:
enumShapeKind{Square,Rectangle,Circle};

structShape{
    intcenterx;
    intcentery;
    enumShapeKindkind;
    union{
        struct{intside;};           /* Square */
        struct{intlength,height;};/* Rectangle */
        struct{intradius;};         /* Circle */
    };};

intgetSquareSide(structShape*s){
    assert(s->kind==Square);
    returns->side;}

voidsetSquareSide(structShape*s,intside){
    s->kind=Square;
    s->side=side;}

/* and so on */As long as the union fields are only accessed through the functions, the accesses will be safe and correct. The same approach can be used for encoded tags; we simply decode the tag and then check it on each access. If the inefficiency of these tag checks is a concern, they may be automatically removed in the final version.
C and C++ also have language support for one particular tagged union: the possibly-null pointer. This may be compared to the option type in ML or the Maybe type in Haskell, and can be seen as a tagged pointer: a tagged union (with an encoded tag) of two types:
Valid pointers,A null pointer type with only one value, null, indicating an exceptional condition.Unfortunately, C compilers do not verify that the null case is always handled, and this is a particularly prevalent source of errors in C code, since there is a tendency to ignore exceptional cases.
2000s[edit]One advanced dialect of C called Cyclone has extensive built-in support for tagged unions.[1]The enum types in the Rust, Haxe and Swift languages also work as tagged unions.
The variant library from Boost has demonstrated it was possible to implement a safe tagged union as a library in C++, visitable using function objects.
structdisplay:boost::static_visitor<void>{
    voidoperator()(inti)
    {
        std::cout<<""It's an int, with value ""<<i<<std::endl;
    }

    voidoperator()(conststd::string&s)
    {
        std::cout<<""It's a string, with value ""<<s<<std::endl;
    }};

boost::variant<int,std::string>v=42;boost::apply_visitor(display(),v);

boost::variant<int,std::string>v=""hello world"";boost::apply_visitor(display(),v);Scala has case classes:
sealedabstractclassTreecaseobjectLeafextendsTreecaseclassNode(value:Int,left:Tree,right:Tree)extendsTree

valtree=Node(5,Node(1,Leaf,Leaf),Node(3,Leaf,Node(4,Leaf,Leaf)))Because the class hierarchy is sealed, the compiler can check that all cases are handled in a pattern match:
treematch{
  caseNode(x,_,_)=>println(""top level node value: ""+x)
  caseLeaf          =>println(""top level node is a leaf"")}Scala's case classes also permit reuse through subtyping:
sealedabstractclassShape(centerX:Int,centerY:Int)caseclassSquare(side:Int,centerX:Int,centerY:Int)extendsShape(centerX,centerY)caseclassRectangle(length:Int,height:Int,centerX:Int,centerY:Int)extendsShape(centerX,centerY)caseclassCircle(radius:Int,centerX:Int,centerY:Int)extendsShape(centerX,centerY)F# has discriminated unions:
typeTree=
  |Leaf
  |Nodeofvalue:int*left:Tree*right:Tree

lettree=Node(5,Node(1,Leaf,Leaf),Node(3,Leaf,Node(4,Leaf,Leaf)))Because the defined cases are exhaustive, the compiler can check that all cases are handled in a pattern match:
matchtreewith|Node(x,_,_)->printfn""top level node value: %i""x|Leaf           ->printfn""top level node is a leaf""Haxe's enums also work as tagged unions[2]:
enumColor{
  Red;
  Green;
  Blue;
  Rgb(r:Int,g:Int,b:Int);}These can be matched using a switch expression:
switch(color){
  caseRed:trace(""Color was red"");
  caseGreen:trace(""Color was green"");
  caseBlue:trace(""Color was blue"");
  caseRgb(r,g,b):trace(""Color had a red value of ""+r);}Nim has object variants[3] similar in declaration to those in Pascal and Ada:type
  ShapeKind=enum
    skSquare,skRectangle,skCircle
  Shape=object
    centerX,centerY:int
    casekind:ShapeKind
    ofskSquare:
      side:int
    ofskRectangle:
      length,height:int
    ofskCircle:
      radius:intMacros can be used to emulate pattern matching or to create syntactic sugar for declaring object variants, seen here as implemented by the package patty:importpatty

proc `~`[A](a:A):refA=
  new(result)
  result[]=a

variantList[A]:
  Nil
  Cons(x:A,xs:refList[A])

proc listHelper[A](xs:seq[A]):List[A]=
  ifxs.len==0:Nil[A]()
  else:Cons(xs[0],~listHelper(xs[1..xs.high]))

proc list[A](xs:varargs[A]):List[A]=listHelper(@xs)

proc sum(xs:List[int]):int=(block:
  matchxs:
    Nil:0
    Cons(y,ys):y+sum(ys[]))

echosum(list(1,2,3,4,5))2010s[edit]The Rust language has extensive support for tagged unions, called enums.[4] For example:
enumTree{    Leaf,    Node(i64,Box<Tree>,Box<Tree>)}It also allows matching on unions:
lettree=Tree::Node(    2,    Box::new(Tree::Node(0,Box::new(Tree::Leaf),Box::new(Tree::Leaf))),    Box::new(Tree::Node(3,Box::new(Tree::Leaf),        Box::new(Tree::Node(4,Box::new(Tree::Leaf),Box::new(Tree::Leaf))))));

fnadd_values(tree: Tree)-> i64{    matchtree{        Tree::Node(v,a,b)=>v+add_values(*a)+add_values(*b),        Tree::Leaf=>0    }}

assert_eq!(add_values(tree),9);Rust's error handling model relies extensively on these tagged unions, especially the Option<T> type, which is either None or Some(T), and the Result<T, E> type, which is either Ok(T) or Err(E).[5]With TypeScript it is possible to create tagged unions as well. For example:
interfaceLeaf{type:""leaf"";value: string;}

interfaceNode{type:""node"";left: Tree;right: Tree;}

typeTree=Leaf|Node

functionvisit(tree: Tree){
    switch(tree.type){
        case""leaf"":
            console.log(tree.value)
            break
        case""node"":
            visit(tree.left)
            visit(tree.right)
            break 
    } 
}Class hierarchies as tagged unions[edit]In a typical class hierarchy in object-oriented programming, each subclass can encapsulate data unique to that class. The metadata used to perform virtual method lookup (for example, the object's vtable pointer in most C++ implementations) identifies the subclass and so effectively acts as a tag identifying the particular data stored by the instance (see RTTI).
An object's constructor sets this tag, and it remains constant throughout the object's lifetime.
Nevertheless, a class hierarchy involves true subtype polymorphism; it can be extended by creating further subclasses of the same base type, which could not be handled correctly under a tag/dispatch model.  Hence, it is usually not possible to do case analysis or dispatch on a subobject's 'tag' as one would for tagged unions.

Registered users can post, like and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read them. Users access Twitter through its website interface, through Short Message Service (SMS) or its mobile-device application software (""app"").[13]Twitter, Inc. is based in San Francisco, California, and has more than 25 offices around the world.[14] Tweets were originally restricted to 140 characters, but was doubled to 280 for non-CJK languages in November 2017.[15] Audio and video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds for most accounts.
Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and launched in July of that year. By 2012, more than 100 million users posted 340 million tweets a day,[16] and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day.[17][18][19] In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as ""the SMS of the Internet"".[20] As of 2018, Twitter had more than 321 million monthly active users.[10]Contents1History1.1Creation and initial reaction1.22007–20101.32011–20141.42015–20161.52017–20191.620202Leadership3Appearance and features3.1Logo and font3.2Tweets3.2.1Content3.2.2Format3.2.2.1Hashtags, usernames, retweets and replies3.2.2.2Twitter Lists3.2.2.3Using SMS3.2.2.4Character limits3.2.2.5Image captions3.2.2.6URL shortener3.2.3Trending topics3.2.4Moments3.3Adding and following content3.4Verified accounts3.5Mobile3.6Third-party applications3.7Related headlines feature3.8Polls3.9Integrated photo-sharing service3.10Streaming video3.11Account archival3.11.1Browsable legacy Twitter archive format3.11.2New machine-readable archive format3.12Fleets4Usage4.1Demographics4.2Decline and levels of use5Finances5.1Funding5.2Revenue sources5.3Stock launch and tax issues5.4Contributions5.5Advertising bans6Technology6.1Implementation6.2Interface6.3Outages7User accounts7.1Privacy, security and harassment7.2Suspect and contested accounts7.3Malicious and fake accounts7.4Twitter bots7.4.1Effects8Developers8.1Innovators patent agreement8.2Open source9Society9.1Usage9.1.1Protesters9.1.2Governments9.2Censorship and moderation9.2.1Hashtag suppression9.2.2Trust & Safety Council9.2.3Moderation of tweets9.3Impact9.3.1Instant, short, and frequent communication9.3.2Emergency use9.3.3Education9.3.4Public figures9.3.5World leaders9.3.6Religion9.4Fines, Penalties and Sanctions9.4.1Violation of campaign finance laws10Television11Statistics11.1User accounts with large follower base11.2Oldest accounts11.3Record tweets12See also13References14Further reading15External links

HistoryFurther information: Timeline of TwitterCreation and initial reaction  A sketch, c. 2006, by Jack Dorsey, envisioning an SMS-based social network.Twitter's origins lie in a ""daylong brainstorming session"" held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo. Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student at New York University, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group.[21][22] The original project code name for the service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass,[23] inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The decision was also partly due to the fact that the domain twitter.com was already in use, and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter.[24] The developers initially considered ""10958"" as a short code, but later changed it to ""40404"" for ""ease of use and memorability"".[25] Work on the project started on March 21, 2006, when Dorsey published the first Twitter message at 9:50 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST): ""just setting up my twttr"".[3] Dorsey has explained the origin of the ""Twitter"" title:
...we came across the word 'twitter', and it was just perfect. The definition was 'a short burst of inconsequential information,' and 'chirps from birds'. And that's exactly what the product was.[26]The first Twitter prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, was used as an internal service for Odeo employees.[27] The full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006.[11] In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo, together with its assets — including Odeo.com and Twitter.com — from the investors and shareholders.[28] Williams fired Glass, who was silent about his part in Twitter's startup until 2011.[29] Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007.[30] Williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a 2013 interview:

With Twitter, it wasn't clear what it was. They called it a social network, they called it microblogging, but it was hard to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of discovery with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.[31]The tipping point for Twitter's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.[32][33] ""The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways, exclusively streaming Twitter messages,"" remarked Newsweek's Steven Levy. ""Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.""[34] Reaction at the conference was highly positive. Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter was ""absolutely ruling"" SXSWi. Social software researcher danah boyd said Twitter was ""owning"" the conference.[35] Twitter staff received the festival's Web Award prize with the remark ""we'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less. And we just did!""[36]The first unassisted off-Earth Twitter message was posted from the International Space Station by NASAastronautT. J. Creamer on January 22, 2010.[37] By late November 2010, an average of a dozen updates per day were posted on the astronauts' communal account, @NASA_Astronauts. NASA has also hosted over 25 ""tweetups"", events that provide guests with VIP access to NASA facilities and speakers with the goal of leveraging participants' social networks to further the outreach goals of NASA. In August 2010, the company appointed Adam Bain from News Corp.'s Fox Audience Network as president of revenue.[38]2007–2010The company experienced rapid initial growth. It had 400,000 tweets posted per quarter in 2007. This grew to 100 million tweets posted per quarter in 2008. In February 2010, Twitter users were sending 50 million tweets per day.[39] By March 2010, the company recorded over 70,000 registered applications.[40] As of June 2010, about 65 million tweets were posted each day, equaling about 750 tweets sent each second, according to Twitter.[41] As of March 2011, that was about 140 million tweets posted daily.[42] As noted on Compete.com, Twitter moved up to the third-highest-ranking social networking site in January 2009 from its previous rank of twenty-second.[43]  Jack Dorsey, co-founder and CEO of Twitter, in 2009Twitter's usage spikes during prominent events. For example, a record was set during the 2010 FIFA World Cup when fans wrote 2,940 tweets per second in the thirty-second period after Japan scored against Cameroon on June 14. The record was broken again when 3,085 tweets per second were posted after the Los Angeles Lakers' victory in the 2010 NBA Finals on June 17,[44] and then again at the close of Japan's victory over Denmark in the World Cup when users published 3,283 tweets per second.[45] The record was set again during the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Final between Japan and the United States, when 7,196 tweets per second were published.[46] When American singer Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, Twitter servers crashed after users were updating their status to include the words ""Michael Jackson"" at a rate of 100,000 tweets per hour.[47] The current record as of August 3, 2013 was set in Japan, with 143,199 tweets per second during a television screening of the movie Castle in the Sky[48] (beating the previous record of 33,388, also set by Japan for the television screening of the same movie).[49]Twitter acquired application developer Atebits on April 11, 2010. Atebits had developed the Apple Design Award-winning Twitter client Tweetie for the Mac and iPhone. The application, now called ""Twitter"" and distributed free of charge, is the official Twitter client for the iPhone, iPad and Mac.[50]From September through October 2010, the company began rolling out ""New Twitter"", an entirely revamped edition of twitter.com. Changes included the ability to see pictures and videos without leaving Twitter itself by clicking on individual tweets which contain links to images and clips from a variety of supported websites including YouTube and Flickr, and a complete overhaul of the interface, which shifted links such as '@mentions' and 'Retweets' above the Twitter stream, while 'Messages' and 'Log Out' became accessible via a black bar at the very top of twitter.com. As of November 1, 2010, the company confirmed that the ""New Twitter experience"" had been rolled out to all users. In 2019, Twitter was announced to be the 10th most downloaded mobile app of the decade, from 2010 to 2019.[51]2011–2014On April 5, 2011, Twitter tested a new homepage and phased out the ""Old Twitter"".[52] However, a glitch came about after the page was launched, so the previous ""retro"" homepage was still in use until the issues were resolved; the new homepage was reintroduced on April 20.[53][54] On December 8, 2011, Twitter overhauled its website once more to feature the ""Fly"" design, which the service says is easier for new users to follow and promotes advertising. In addition to the Home tab, the Connect and Discover tabs were introduced along with a redesigned profile and timeline of Tweets. The site's layout has been compared to that of Facebook.[55][56] On February 21, 2012, it was announced that Twitter and Yandex agreed to a partnership. Yandex, a Russian search engine, finds value within the partnership due to Twitter's real time news feeds. Twitter's director of business development explained that it is important to have Twitter content where Twitter users go.[57] On March 21, 2012, Twitter celebrated its sixth birthday while also announcing that it had 140 million users and 340 million tweets per day. The number of users was up 40% from their September 2011 number, which was said to have been at 100 million at the time.[58]In April 2012, Twitter announced that it was opening an office in Detroit, with the aim of working with automotive brands and advertising agencies.[59] Twitter also expanded its office in Dublin.[60] On June 5, 2012, a modified logo was unveiled through the company blog, removing the text to showcase the slightly redesigned bird as the sole symbol of Twitter.[61][62] On October 5, 2012, Twitter acquired a video clip company called Vine that launched in January 2013.[63][64] Twitter released Vine as a standalone app that allows users to create and share six-second looping video clips on January 24, 2013. Vine videos shared on Twitter are visible directly in users' Twitter feeds.[65] Due to an influx of inappropriate content, it is now rated 17+ in Apple's[needs update][66] app store.[67] On December 18, 2012, Twitter announced it had surpassed 200 million monthly active users. Twitter hit 100 million monthly active users in September 2011.[68]On January 28, 2013, Twitter acquired Crashlytics in order to build out its mobile developer products.[69]On April 18, 2013, Twitter launched a music app called Twitter Music for the iPhone.[70] On August 28, 2013, Twitter acquired Trendrr,[71] followed by the acquisition of MoPub on September 9, 2013.[72] As of September 2013, the company's data showed that 200 million users sent over 400 million tweets daily, with nearly 60% of tweets sent from mobile devices.[73] On June 4, 2014, Twitter announced that it would acquire Namo Media, a technology firm specializing in ""native advertising"" for mobile devices.[74] On June 19, 2014, Twitter announced that it had reached an undisclosed deal to buy SnappyTV, a service that helps edit and share video from television broadcasts.[75][76] The company was helping broadcasters and rights holders to share video content both organically across social and via Twitter's Amplify program.[77] In July 2014, Twitter announced that it intended to buy a young company called CardSpring for an undisclosed sum. CardSpring enabled retailers to offer online shoppers coupons that they could automatically sync to their credit cards in order to receive discounts when they shopped in physical stores.[78] On July 31, 2014, Twitter announced that it had acquired a small password-security startup called Mitro.[79] On October 29, 2014, Twitter announced a new partnership with IBM. The partnership was intended to help businesses use Twitter data to understand their customers, businesses and other trends.[80]2015–2016On February 11, 2015, Twitter announced that it had acquired Niche, an advertising network for social media stars, founded by Rob Fishman and Darren Lachtman.[81] The acquisition price was reportedly $50 million.[82] On March 13, 2015, Twitter announced its acquisition of Periscope, an app that allows live streaming of video.[83] In April 2015, the Twitter.com desktop homepage changed.[84] Twitter announced that it had acquired TellApart, a commerce ads tech firm, with $532 million stock.[85][86] Later in the year it became apparent that growth had slowed, according to Fortune,[87] Business Insider,[88] Marketing Land[89] and other news websites including Quartz (in 2016).[90] In June 2016, Twitter acquired an artificial intelligence startup called Magic Pony for $150 million.[91][92]2017–2019In 2019, Twitter redesigned its user interface yet again. This newest ""new Twitter"" was deployed in ""a gradual rollout"".[93]2020Twitter saw somewhat dramatic growth in 2020, possibly due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[94] During said pandemic, Twitter saw an increased use of the platform for misinformation related to the pandemic.[95] Twitter announced in March 2020 that it would start marking tweets which may contain misleading information, in some cases it will provide links to pages of fact-checking information.[96]A major hack of Twitter on July 15, 2020 affected 130 high-profile accounts, both verified and unverified ones such as Barack Obama, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk; the hack allowed bitcoin scammers to send tweets via the compromised accounts that asked the followers to send bitcoin to a given public address, with the promise to double their money.[97] Within a few hours, Twitter disabled tweeting and reset passwords from all verified accounts.[97] Analysis of the event revealed that the scammers had used social engineering to obtain credentials from Twitter employees to access an administration tool used by Twitter to view and change these accounts' personal details as to gain access as part of a ""smash and grab"" attempt to make money quickly, with an estimated US$120,000 in bitcoin deposited in various accounts before Twitter intervened.[98] Several law enforcement entities including the FBI launched investigations into the attack to determine the perpetrators over concerns of broader implications of such a hack in the future.[99]LeadershipAs chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of capital funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company.[100] On October 16, 2008,[101] Williams took over the role of CEO, and Dorsey became chairman of the board.[102] On October 4, 2010, Williams announced that he was stepping down as CEO. Dick Costolo, formerly Twitter's chief operating officer, became CEO. On October 4, 2010, Williams made an announcement saying that he will stay with the company and ""be completely focused on product strategy"".[103][104]According to The New York Times, ""Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Costolo forged a close relationship"" when Williams was away.[105] According to PC Magazine, Williams was ""no longer involved in the day-to-day goings on at the company"". He was focused on developing a new startup, and became a member of Twitter's board of directors, and promised to ""help in any way [he could]"". In 2011, Stone was still with Twitter but was working with AOL as an ""advisor on volunteer efforts and philanthropy"".[106] In January 2014, Stone announced the release of Jelly, a 'social Q&A network for mobile'.[107] Dorsey rejoined Twitter in March 2011, as executive chairman focusing on product development. At that time, he split his schedule with Square (where he is CEO), whose offices are within walking distance of Twitter's in San Francisco.[105]In September 2011, board members and investors Fred Wilson and Bijan Sabet resigned from Twitter's board of directors.[108] In October 2012, Twitter announced it had hired former Google executive Matt Derella to become their new director of business agency development.[109] Twitter named former Goldman Sachs executive Anthony Noto as the company's CFO in July 2014, with an ""annual salary of $250,000 and one-time restricted stock options of 1.5 million shares ... valued at $61.5 million"".[110] On June 10, 2015, Twitter announced its CEO Dick Costolo would resign on July 1, 2015.[111] Noto was said to be considered a potential replacement for outgoing CEO Costolo.[112] On October 14, 2015, former Google chief business officer Omid Kordestani became executive chairman, replacing Dorsey who remains CEO.[113] On January 26, 2016, Leslie Berland, former executive vice president of global advertising, marketing, and digital partnerships at American Express, was named chief marketing officer.[114] In November 2016, COO Adam Bain announced his resignation and CFO Anthony Noto took over Bain's role.[115][116] A month later, on December 20, 2016, CTO Adam Messinger announced that he too was leaving.[117][118]In February 2020, it was reported that Elliott Management Corporation had acquired a stake in Twitter, with activist shareholder and Republican Party supporter Paul Singer expected to seek the removal of Dorsey as CEO.[119] Twitter agreed to appoint a new independent director and two new board members, and to perform $2 billion in share buybacks.[120]Appearance and featuresLogo and font  The Twitter logo from September 14, 2010 – June 5, 2012, featuring the silhouette version of ""Larry the Bird""Twitter has become internationally identifiable by its signature bird logo, or the Twitter Bird. The original logo, which was simply the word ""Twitter"", was in use from its launch in March 2006. It was accompanied by an image of a bird which was later discovered to be a piece of clip art created by the British graphic designer Simon Oxley.[121] A new logo had to be redesigned by founder Biz Stone with help from designer Philip Pascuzzo, which resulted in a more cartoon-like bird in 2009. This version had been dubbed ""Larry the Bird"" specifically named after Larry Bird of the NBA's Boston Celtics fame.[122][123] Within a year, the Larry the Bird logo underwent a redesign by Stone and Pascuzzo to eliminate the cartoon features, leaving a solid silhouette of Larry the Bird that was used from 2010 through 2012.[122] In 2012, Douglas Bowman created a further simplified version of Larry the Bird, keeping the solid silhouette but making it more similar to a mountain bluebird.[124] This new logo was called simply the ""Twitter Bird,"" and has been used as the company's branding since.[122][125]On May 30, 2014, Twitter announced, ""Starting today, we're rolling out a new font on twitter.com, moving from Helvetica Neue to Gotham"".[126]Tweets  The Twitter account page for Wikipedia, demonstrating the account-customized timeline view which shows tweets in reverse chronological orderTweets are publicly visible by default, but senders can restrict message delivery to only their followers. Users can mute users they do not wish to interact with and block accounts from viewing their tweets.[127][128] Users can tweet via the Twitter website, compatible external applications (such as for smartphones), or by Short Message Service (SMS) available in certain countries.[129] Users may subscribe to other users' tweets—this is known as ""following"" and subscribers are known as ""followers""[130] or ""tweeps"", a portmanteau of Twitter and peeps.[131] Individual tweets can be forwarded by other users to their own feed, a process known as a ""retweet"". Users can also ""like"" (formerly ""favorite"") individual tweets.[132] Twitter allows users to update their profile via their mobile phone either by text messaging or by apps released for certain smartphones and tablets.[133] Twitter has been compared to a web-based Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client.[134] In a 2009 Time magazine essay, technology author Steven Johnson described the basic mechanics of Twitter as ""remarkably simple"":
.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}As a social network, Twitter revolves around the principle of followers. When you choose to follow another Twitter user, that user's tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your main Twitter page. If you follow 20 people, you'll see a mix of tweets scrolling down the page: breakfast-cereal updates, interesting new links, music recommendations, even musings on the future of education.[135]According to research published in April 2014, around 44% of user accounts have never tweeted.[136]The first tweet was posted by Jack Dorsey (creator) at 12:50 PM PST on March 21, 2006 and read ""just setting up my twttr"".[137] In 2009, the first tweet was sent from space. US astronauts Nicola Stott and Jeff Williams took part in a live 'tweetup' from the International Space Station with around 35 members of the public at NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC.[138]Content  Content of tweets according to Pear Analytics .mw-parser-output .legend{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .legend-color{display:inline-block;min-width:1.25em;height:1.25em;line-height:1.25;margin:1px 0;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:transparent;color:black}.mw-parser-output .legend-text{}  News (3.6%)  Spam (3.8%)  Self-promotion (5.9%)  Pointless babble (40.1%)  Conversational (37.6%)  Pass-along value (8.7%)San Antonio-based market-research firm Pear Analytics analyzed 2,000 tweets (originating from the United States and in English) over a two-week period in August 2009 from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm (CST) and separated them into six categories.[139]Pointless babble made up 40%, with 38% being conversational. Pass-along value had 9%, self-promotion 6% with spam and news each making 4%.
Despite Jack Dorsey's own open contention that a message on Twitter is ""a short burst of inconsequential information"", social networking researcher danah boyd responded to the Pear Analytics survey by arguing that what the Pear researchers labeled ""pointless babble"" is better characterized as ""social grooming"" and/or ""peripheral awareness"" (which she justifies as persons ""want[ing] to know what the people around them are thinking and doing and feeling, even when co-presence isn't viable"").[140] Similarly, a survey of Twitter users found that a more specific social role of passing along messages that include a hyperlink is an expectation of reciprocal linking by followers.[141]FormatHashtags, usernames, retweets and replies""Twitter hashtag"" redirects here.

Similarly, the ""@"" sign followed by a username is used for mentioning or replying to other users.[142]To repost a message from another Twitter user and share it with one's own followers, a user can click the retweet button within the Tweet. Users can reply other accounts' replies. Since November 2019, users can hide replies to their messages. Since May 2020, users can select who can reply each of their messages: anyone, accounts who follow the poster, specific accounts, and none.[143]Twitter ListsIn late 2009, the ""Twitter Lists"" feature was added, making it possible for users to follow ad hoc lists of authors instead of individual authors.[130][144]Using SMSThrough SMS, users can communicate with Twitter through five gateway numbers: short codes for the United States, Canada, India, New Zealand, and an Isle of Man-based number for international use. There is also a short code in the United Kingdom which is only accessible to those on the Vodafone, O2[145] and Orange[146] networks. In India, since Twitter only supports tweets from Bharti Airtel,[147] an alternative platform called smsTweet[148] was set up by a user to work on all networks.[149] A similar platform called GladlyCast exists for mobile phone users in Singapore and Malaysia.[150]The tweets were set to a largely constrictive 140-character limit for compatibility with SMS messaging, introducing the shorthand notation and slang commonly used in SMS messages. The 140-character limit also increased the usage of URL shortening services such as bit.ly, goo.gl, tinyurl.com, tr.im, and other content-hosting services such as TwitPic, memozu.com and NotePub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than 140 characters. Since June 2011, Twitter has used its own t.co domain for automatic shortening of all URLs posted on its site, making other link shorteners unnecessary for staying within Twitter's 140 character limit.[151][152]In August 2019, Jack Dorsey's account was hacked by using Twitter's SMS to tweet feature to send crude messages. Days later, the ability to send a tweet via SMS was temporarily turned off.[153]In April 2020, Twitter discontinued the ability to receive SMS messages containing the text of new tweets in most countries.[154][155]Character limitsIn 2016, Twitter announced that media such as photos, videos, and the person's handle, would not count against the already constrictive 140 character limit. A user photo post used to count for a large chunk of a Tweet, about 24 characters.[156] Attachments and links would also no longer be part of the character limit.[157]Since March 30, 2017, the Twitter handles are outside the tweet itself, therefore they no longer count towards the character limit.[158] Only new Twitter handles added to the conversation count towards the limit.
In 2017, Twitter doubled their historical 140-character-limitation to 280.[159] Under the new limit, glyphs are counted as a variable number of characters, depending upon the script they are from: most European letters and punctuation forms count as one character, while each CJK glyph counts as two so that only 140 such glyphs can be used in a tweet.[159]Image captionsOn Tuesday, 2016-03-29, Twitter introduced a feature to improve accessibility for visually impaired people:[160] A caption with the length of up to 420 characters[161] can be added to each image optionally.
This caption can be accessed by screen reading software or by hovering the mouse above a picture inside TweetDeck.
URL shortenert.co is a URL shortening service created by Twitter.[151] It is only available for links posted to Twitter and not available for general use.[151] All links posted to Twitter use a t.co wrapper.[162] Twitter hopes that the service will be able to protect users from malicious sites,[151] and will use it to track clicks on links within tweets.[151][163]Having used the services of third parties TinyURL and bit.ly,[164] Twitter began experimenting with its own URL shortening service for private messages in March 2010 using the twt.tl domain,[162] before it purchased the t.co domain. The service was tested on the main site using the accounts @TwitterAPI, @rsarver and @raffi.[162] On September 2, 2010, an email from Twitter to users said they would be expanding the roll-out of the service to users. On June 7, 2011, Twitter announced that it was rolling out the feature.[152]Trending topicsMain article: Twitter trends  Countries and cities with local trending topics in TwitterA word, phrase, or topic that is mentioned at a greater rate than others is said to be a ""trending topic"". Trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users or because of an event that prompts people to talk about a specific topic.[165] These topics help Twitter and their users to understand what is happening in the world and what people's opinions are about it.[166]Trending topics are sometimes the result of concerted efforts and manipulations by preteen and teenaged fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena, particularly musicians like Lady Gaga (known as Little Monsters), Justin Bieber (Beliebers), Rihanna (Rih Navy) and One Direction (Directioners), and novel series Twilight (Twihards) and Harry Potter (Potterheads). Twitter has altered the trend algorithm in the past to prevent manipulation of this type with limited success.[167]The Twitter web interface displays a list of trending topics on a sidebar on the home page, along with sponsored content (see image).
Twitter often censors trending hashtags that are claimed to be abusive or offensive. Twitter censored the #Thatsafrican[168] and #thingsdarkiessay hashtags after users complained that they found the hashtags offensive.[169] There are allegations that Twitter removed #NaMOinHyd from the trending list and added an Indian National Congress-sponsored hashtag.[170]MomentsIn October 2015, Twitter introduced ""Moments""—a feature that allows users to curate tweets from other users into a larger collection. Twitter initially intended the feature to be used by its in-house editorial team and other partners; they populated a dedicated tab in Twitter's apps, chronicling news headlines, sporting events, and other content.[171][172] In September 2016, creation of moments became available to all Twitter users.[173]Adding and following contentThere are numerous tools for adding content, monitoring content and conversations including Twitter's own TweetDeck, Salesforce.com, HootSuite, and Twitterfeed.com. As of 2009[update], fewer than half of tweets posted were posted using the web user interface with most users using third-party applications (based on an analysis of 500 million tweets by Sysomos).[174]Verified accounts  The official Twitter profile of Twitter, Inc. The blue check mark right of the profile name indicates that it is a verified account.In June 2009, after being criticized by Kanye West and sued by Tony La Russa over unauthorized accounts run by impersonators, Twitter launched their 'Verified Accounts' program.[175][176] Twitter stated that an account with a ""blue tick"" verification badge indicates ""we've been in contact with the person or entity the account is representing and verified that it is approved.""[177] After the beta period, Twitter stated in their FAQ that the company ""proactively verifies accounts on an ongoing basis to make it easier for users to find who they’re looking for"" and that they ""do not accept requests for verification from the general public.""[178]In July 2016, Twitter announced a public application process to grant verified status to an account ""if it is determined to be of public interest"" and that verification ""does not imply an endorsement.""[179][180][181] As of November 2017, Twitter continued to deny verification of Julian Assange following his requests.[182] In November 2017, the company suspended the verification process and announced plans to refine it in response to backlash after white nationalist Jason Kessler had his account verified on Twitter.[183][184][185]Verified status allows access to some features unavailable to other users, such as only seeing mentions from other verified accounts.[186]In a March 8, 2018 live-stream on Twitter's Periscope, Dorsey discussed the idea of allowing any user to get a verified account. ""The intention is to open verification to everyone, and to do it in a way that is scalable where [Twitter is] not in the way,"" Dorsey said. ""And people can verify more facts about themselves, and we don’t have to be the judge or imply any bias on our part.""[187]In November 2019, Dalit activists of India alleged that higher caste people get Twitter verification easily and trended hashtags #CancelAllBlueTicksInIndia and #CasteistTwitter.[188][189][190] Critics have commented that Twitter's verification process is not transparent and causes digital marginalisation of already marginalised communities.[191] Twitter India rejected the allegations, calling them 'impartial' and working on a 'case-by-case' policy.[192][193]In November 2020, Twitter announced relaunching of its verification system in 2021, and that the verification system would rely in part upon Wikipedia. According to the proposed new policy, Twitter will verify six different types of accounts, and for three of them (companies, brands, and influential individuals like activists), the presence of a Wikipedia page will be one criterion for showing that the account has ""Off Twitter Notability"".[194]Mobile  The mobile version of Twitter[195]Twitter has mobile apps for iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows 10, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, and Nokia S40.[196] Users can also tweet by sending SMS.[197] In April 2017, Twitter introduced Twitter Lite, a progressive web app designed for regions with unreliable and slow Internet connections, with a size of less than one megabyte, designed for devices with limited storage capacity.[198][199]This has been released in countries with slow internet connection such as the Philippines.[200]Twitter Lite has evolved into the main Twitter web interface, see section ""interface"".[citation needed]Third-party applicationsFor many years, Twitter has limited the use of third-party applications accessing the service by implementing a 100,000 user limit per application.[201] Since August 2010, third-party Twitter applications have been required to use OAuth, an authentication method that does not require users to enter their password into the authenticating application. This was done to increase security and improve the user experience.[202]Related headlines featureThis feature adds websites to the bottom of a tweet's permalink page. If a website embedded a tweet onto one of their stories, the tweet will show the websites that mentioned the tweet. This feature was added onto Twitter so if the viewer doesn't understand what the tweet means, they can click on the sites to read more about what the person is talking about.[203]PollsIn 2015, Twitter began to roll out the ability to attach poll questions to tweets. Polls are open for up to 7 days, and voters are not personally identified.[204]Initially, polls could have only two options with a maximum of twenty characters per option. Later[when?], the ability to add four options with up to 25 characters per option, was added.
Integrated photo-sharing serviceOn June 1, 2011, Twitter announced its own integrated photo-sharing service that enables users to upload a photo and attach it to a Tweet right from Twitter.com.[205] Users now also have the ability to add pictures to Twitter's search by adding hashtags to the tweet.[206] Twitter also plans to provide photo galleries designed to gather and syndicate all photos that a user has uploaded on Twitter and third-party services such as TwitPic.[206]Streaming videoIn 2016, Twitter began to place a larger focus on live streaming video programming, hosting various events including streams of the Republican and Democratic conventions during the U.S. presidential campaign as part of a partnership with CBS News,[207]Dreamhack and ESLeSports events,[208] and winning a bid for non-exclusive streaming rights to ten NFLThursday Night Football games in the 2016 season.[208][209]During an event in New York in May 2017, Twitter announced that it planned to construct a 24-hour streaming video channel hosted within the service, featuring content from various partners.[208][210] CEO Jack Dorsey stated that the digital video strategy was part of a goal for Twitter to be ""the first place that anyone hears of anything going on that matters to them""; as of the first quarter of 2017, Twitter had over 200 content partners, who streamed over 800 hours of video over 450 events.[211]Twitter announced a number of new and expanded partnerships for its streaming video services at the event, including Bloomberg, BuzzFeed, Cheddar (Opening Bell and Closing Bell shows; the latter was introduced in October 2016) IMG Fashion (coverage of fashion events), Live Nation Entertainment (streaming concert events), Major League Baseball (weekly online game stream, plus a weekly program with live look-ins and coverage of trending stories), MTV and BET (red carpet coverage for their MTV Video Music Awards, MTV Movie & TV Awards, and BET Awards), NFL Network (the Monday-Thursday news program NFL Blitz Live, and Sunday Fantasy Gameday),[212][213] the PGA Tour (PGA Tour Live coverage of early tournament rounds preceding television coverage),[214]The Players' Tribune, Ben Silverman and Howard T. Owens' Propagate (daily entertainment show #WhatsHappening), The Verge (weekly technology show Circuit Breaker: The Verge’s Gadget Show), Stadium (a new digital sports network being formed by Silver Chalice and Sinclair Broadcast Group)[215][216][217] and the WNBA (weekly game).[211]Account archivalTwitter has offered two different methods[clarify] of archiving one's own Twitter account data. Those methods have their individual benefits and disadvantages. Since August 2019, only the latter archival method is available.[citation needed]Browsable legacy Twitter archive formatIn December 2012, Twitter introduced a ""Tweet archival"" feature, which created a ZIP file that contains an offline-browsable archive of all tweets.[218]Those exported tweets could be browsed and searched offline by using the bundled user-interface accessible through an Internet browser, which used client-side, JavaScript-powered pagination.[219]The user interface of the tweet archive browser had a design similar to Twitter's 2010–2014 desktop user interface, even until the feature's removal.
The tweet text contents, ID's, time data and source labels are located in the file called ""tweets.csv"".
The ability to export this type of tweet archive, which never existed on the new layout, has been removed entirely in August 2019[when exactly?], after co-existing with the new 2018 data archival method.
Even when accessing the legacy Twitter desktop website layout using the user-agent of an older browser version, the option has disappeared from the account settings.
It was possible to request at least 1 archive per day[verification needed].
New machine-readable archive formatDue to the legalGDPR §20 obligation (effective since May 2018) to provide data portability, social media services had to introduce advanced data export  capabilities and utilities.
The original browsable tweet archives did lack a lot of metadata, especially about the account itself, which the new machine-readable archival feature does contain:
Account ID and creation dateDirect messagesList of:
Following users + countFollowed users + countBlocked user IDsMuted user IDsLiked tweetsTwitter MomentsInformation about Periscope accountSaved searchesScreen name changesAssociated mobile phone numberVarious account settingsUsers in created Twitter ListsMember of which Twitter ListsAdvanced tweet metadata (e.g. tweet source tag)More…The tweet contents are located in the file called ""tweet.js"".
However, this new archival format contains all uploaded multimedia in the highest resolution, which makes its file size usually multiple times as large.
Additionally, the integrated tweet browser from the legacy archival feature is not bundled.
Another disadvantage is that one can only generate one of these archives per 30 days.
After obtaining this archive, one has to wait 30 days until requesting the next archive is possible. During that timespan, the previous archive remains downloadable from the account settings.
This feature co-existed with the original browsable tweet archival feature since early 2018, until the latter was removed in August 2019.
FleetsIn 2020, Twitter began to test an Instagram/Snapchat story-like feature in some parts of the world.[220] This new feature was called ""Fleets"". They were first launched in Brazil in the month of March.[220] In June 2020, Fleets was launched in India.[221] A user can add a text, pictures and videos in a fleet, which will disappear after 24 hours.[220] The ""Fleets"" feature officially launched on November 17, 2020.[222][223]In December 2020, a new feature was launched allowing users to share tweets directly to Snap Inc’s photo messaging app Snapchat. In addition, Twitter will test a similar feature  for stories on Facebook Inc’s Instagram for a small group of iOS users[224].
UsageDaily user estimates vary as the company does not publish statistics on active accounts. A February 2009 Compete.com blog entry ranked Twitter as the third most used social network based on their count of 6 million unique monthly visitors and 55 million monthly visits.[43] In 2009, Twitter had a monthly user retention rate of forty percent.[225] Twitter had annual growth of 1,382 percent, increasing from 475,000 unique visitors in February 2008 to 7 million in February 2009. Twitter's annual growth rate decreased from 7.8 percent in 2015 to 3.4 percent in 2017.[226] An April 2017 a statista.com blog entry ranked Twitter as the tenth most used social network based on their count of 319 million monthly visitors.[227] Its global user base in 2017 was 328 million.[228] As per August 2018, Twitter light (data saving app) is available in 45 countries.[229]DemographicsThis section needs to be updated.

Excludes visitation from public computers such as Internet cafes or access from mobile phones or PDAs.In 2009, Twitter was mainly used by older adults who might not have used other social sites before Twitter, said Jeremiah Owyang, an industry analyst studying social media. ""Adults are just catching up to what teens have been doing for years,"" he said.[232] According to comScore only eleven percent of Twitter's users are aged twelve to seventeen.[232] comScore attributed this to Twitter's ""early adopter period"" when the social network first gained popularity in business settings and news outlets attracting primarily older users. However, comScore also stated in 2009 that Twitter had begun to ""filter more into the mainstream"", and ""along with it came a culture of celebrity as Shaq, Britney Spears and Ashton Kutcher joined the ranks of the Twitterati"".[233]According to a study by Sysomos in June 2009, women make up a slightly larger Twitter demographic than men—fifty-three percent over forty-seven percent. It also stated that five percent of users accounted for seventy-five percent of all activity and that New York City has more Twitter users than other cities.[234]According to Quancast, twenty-seven million people in the US used Twitter as of September 3, 2009. Sixty-three percent of Twitter users are under thirty-five years old; sixty percent of Twitter users are Caucasian, but a higher than average (compared to other Internet properties) are African American/black (sixteen percent) and Hispanic (eleven percent); fifty-eight percent of Twitter users have a total household income of at least US$60,000.[235] The prevalence of African American Twitter usage and in many popular hashtags has been the subject of research studies.[236][237]On September 7, 2011, Twitter announced that it had 100 million active users logging in at least once a month and 50 million active users every day.[238]In an article published on January 6, 2012, Twitter was confirmed to be the biggest social media network in Japan, with Facebook following closely in second. comScore confirmed this, stating that Japan was the only country in the world where Twitter leads Facebook.[239]On March 31, 2014, Twitter announced there were 255 million monthly active users (MAUs) and 198 million mobile MAUs.[240] In 2013, there were over 100 million users actively using Twitter daily and about 500 million Tweets every day,[241] with about 29% of users checking Twitter multiple times a day.[242]In 2012, the country with the most active users on Twitter was the United States.[243] A 2016 Pew research poll found that Twitter is used by 24% of all online US adults. It was equally popular with men and women (24% and 25% of online Americans respectively), but more popular with younger (36% of 18-29 year olds) generations.[244]Decline and levels of useFollowing a high of 24% in 2016, in 2019, Pew Research had found its overall usage had dropped to 22%.[245] Media outlets have pointed out not to rely on twitter as a representative of the population, saying ""Twitter is not America"",[246] stating that only 10% of users tweet actively, and that 90% of twitter users have tweeted no more than twice.
Finances 
For the fiscal year 2017, Twitter reported losses of US$108 million, with an annual revenue of $2.443 billion, a decrease of 3.9% over the previous fiscal cycle. Twitter's shares traded at over $17 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$25.6 billion in October 2018.

Funding  Twitter's San Francisco headquarters located at 1355 Market StreetTwitter raised over US$57 million from venture capitalist growth funding, although exact figures are not publicly disclosed. Twitter's first A round of funding was for an undisclosed amount that is rumored to have been between US$1 million and US$5 million.[253] Its second B round of funding in 2008 was for US$22 million[254] and its third C round of funding in 2009 was for US$35 million from Institutional Venture Partners and Benchmark Capital along with an undisclosed amount from other investors including Union Square Ventures, Spark Capital, and Insight Venture Partners.[253] Twitter is backed by Union Square Ventures, Digital Garage, Spark Capital, and Bezos Expeditions.[255]In May 2008, The Industry Standard remarked that Twitter's long-term viability is limited by a lack of revenue.[256] Twitter board member Todd Chaffee forecast that the company could profit from e-commerce, noting that users may want to buy items directly from Twitter since it already provides product recommendations and promotions.[257]By March 2009 communications consultant Bill Douglass predicted in an interview that Twitter would be worth $1 billion within six months,[258] which came to pass when the company closed a financing round valuing it at $1 billion in September of that year.[259]The company raised US$200 million in new venture capital in December 2010, at a valuation of approximately US$3.7 billion.[260] In March 2011, 35,000 Twitter shares sold for US$34.50 each on Sharespost, an implied valuation of US$7.8 billion.[261] In August 2010 Twitter announced a ""significant"" investment led by Digital Sky Technologies that, at US$800 million, was reported to be the largest venture round in history.[262]In December 2011, the Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal invested US$300 million in Twitter. The company was valued at US$8.4 billion at the time.[263] In 2016, Twitter was valued by Forbes at US$15.7 billion.[264]Revenue sourcesIn July 2009, some of Twitter's revenue and user growth documents were published on TechCrunch after being illegally obtained by Hacker Croll. The documents projected 2009 revenues of US$400,000 in the third quarter and US$4 million in the fourth quarter along with 25 million users by the end of the year. The projections for the end of 2013 were US$1.54 billion in revenue, US$111 million in net earnings, and one billion users.[265] No information about how Twitter planned to achieve those numbers was published. In response, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone published a blog post suggesting the possibility of legal action against the hacker.[266]On April 13, 2010, Twitter announced plans to offer paid advertising for companies that would be able to purchase ""promoted tweets"" to appear in selective search results on the Twitter website, similar to Google Adwords' advertising model. As of April 13, Twitter announced it had already signed up a number of companies wishing to advertise, including Sony Pictures, Red Bull, Best Buy, and Starbucks.[267][268]The company generated US$45 million in annual revenue in 2010, after beginning sales midway through that year; the company operated at a loss through most of 2010.[260]Users' photos can generate royalty-free revenue for Twitter, and an agreement with World Entertainment News Network (WENN) was announced in May 2011.[269] In June 2011, Twitter announced that it would offer small businesses a self-service advertising system.[270] Twitter generated US$139.5 million in advertising sales during 2011.
The self-service advertising platform was launched in March 2012 to American Express card members and merchants in the U.S. on an invite-only basis. Twitter later reported that numerous small businesses and people who used the self-service tool provided feedback that indicated they were impressed by the feature.[271] To continue their advertising campaign, Twitter announced on March 20, 2012, that promoted tweets would be introduced to mobile devices.[272] In April 2013, Twitter announced that its Twitter Ads self-service platform, consisting of promoted tweets and promoted accounts, was available to all U.S. users without an invite.[271]Twitter's financial revenue statistics for the first quarter of 2014 was reported as US$250 million.[240]On August 3, 2016, Twitter launched Instant Unlock Card, a new feature that encourages people to tweet about a brand in order to earn rewards and utilize the social media network's conversational ads. The format itself consists of images or videos with call-to-action buttons and a customizable hashtag.[273]Stock launch and tax issues  Twitter's San Francisco headquarters, as seen from a corner on Market StreetOn September 12, 2013, Twitter announced that it had filed papers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ahead of a planned stock market listing.[274] It revealed its prospectus in an 800-page filing.[275] Twitter planned to raise US$1 billion as the basis for its stock market debut.[276] The initial public offering (IPO) filing states that ""200,000,000+ monthly active users"" access Twitter and ""500,000,000+ tweets per day"" are posted.[31][277] In an October 15, 2013 amendment to their SEC S-1 filing,[278] Twitter declared that they would list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), quashing speculation that their stock would trade on the NASDAQ exchange. This decision was widely viewed to be a reaction to the botched initial public offering of Facebook.[279] On November 6, 2013, 70 million shares[280] were priced at US$26 and issued by lead underwriter Goldman Sachs.[281]On November 7, 2013, the first day of trading on the NYSE, Twitter shares opened at $26.00 and closed at US$44.90, giving the company a valuation of around US$31 billion.[282] Consequently executives and early investors marginally increased their capital, including co-founders Williams and Dorsey who received a sum of US$2.56 billion and US$1.05 billion respectively, while Costolo's payment was US$345 million.[283] On February 5, 2014, Twitter published its first results as a public company, showing a net loss of $511 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.[284] On January 5, 2016, CEO Jack Dorsey commented on a report that Twitter planned to expand its character limit to 10,000 (private messages already had the longer limit as of July), requiring users to click to see anything beyond 140 characters. He said while Twitter would ""never lose that feeling"" of speed, users could do more with the text.[285]In September 2016, Twitter shares rose 20% after a report that it had received takeover approaches.[286] Potential buyers were Alphabet (the parent company of Google),[286]Microsoft,[287][288][289]Salesforce.com,[286][290]Verizon,[290] and The Walt Disney Company.[291][292] Twitter's board of directors were open to a deal, which could have come by the end of 2016.[286][293] However, no deal was made, with reports in October stating that all the potential buyers dropped out partly due to concerns over abuse and harassment on the service.[294][295][296] In June 2017, Twitter revamped its dashboard to improve the new user experience.[297][298]In November 2017, the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment, revealed that Twitter is among the corporations that avoided paying taxes by using offshore companies.[299] Later The New York Times reported that Russian-American billionaire Yuri Milner had strong Kremlin backing for his investments in Facebook and Twitter.[300]Contributions99.33 percent  ($574,601) of donations of $200 or more from Twitter employees toward the category of “all federal candidates” have gone to Democrats,  versus0.67 percent ($3,897) to Republicans.[301]Advertising bansIn October 2017, Twitter banned the Russian media outlets RT and Sputnik from advertising on their website following the conclusions of the U.S. national intelligence report the previous January that both Sputnik and RT had been used as vehicles for Russia's interference in the 2016 US presidential election.[302]Maria Zakharova for the Russian foreign ministry said the ban was a ""gross violation"" by the US of free speech.[303]In October 2019, Twitter announced it would stop running political ads on its ad platform effective November 22. This resulted from several spurious claims made by political ads. Company CEO Dorsey clarified that internet advertising had great power and was extremely effective for commercial advertisers, the power brings significant risks to politics where crucial decisions impact millions of lives.[304]TechnologyImplementationTwitter places great reliance on open-source software.[305] The Twitter Web interface uses the Ruby on Rails framework,[306] deployed on a performance enhanced Ruby Enterprise Edition implementation of Ruby.[307]In the early days of Twitter, tweets were stored in MySQL databases that were temporally sharded (large databases were split based on time of posting). After the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases, the company decided that the system needed re-engineering.[308]From Spring 2007 to 2008, the messages were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling.[309]  Since 2009, implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala.[310] The switch from Ruby to Scala and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200–300 requests per second per host to around 10,000–20,000 requests per second per host. This boost was greater than the 10x improvement that Twitter's engineers envisioned when starting the switch. The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.[308]As of April 6, 2011, Twitter engineers confirmed that they had switched away from their Ruby on Rails search stack to a Java server they call Blender.[8]Individual tweets are registered under unique IDs using software called snowflake, and geolocation data is added using 'Rockdove'. The URL shortener t.co then checks for a spam link and shortens the URL. Next, the tweets are stored in a MySQL database using Gizzard, and the user receives an acknowledgement that the tweets were sent. Tweets are then sent to search engines via the Firehose API. The process is managed by FlockDB and takes an average of 350 ms.[305]On August 16, 2013, Raffi Krikorian, Twitter's vice president of platform engineering, shared in a blog post that the company's infrastructure handled almost 143,000 tweets per second during that week, setting a new record. Krikorian explained that Twitter achieved this record by blending its homegrown and open source technologies.[308][311]The service's application programming interface (API) allows other web services and applications to integrate with Twitter.[312]InterfaceTwitter introduced the first major redesign of its user interface in September 2010, adopting a dual-pane layout with a navigation bar along the top of the screen, and an increased focus on the inline embedding of multimedia content. Critics considered the redesign an attempt to emulate features and experiences found in mobile apps and third-party Twitter clients.[313][314][315][316]The new layout was revised in 2011 with a focus on continuity with the web and mobile versions, introducing ""Connect"" (interactions with other users such as replies) and ""Discover"" (further information regarding trending topics and news headlines) tabs, an updated profile design, and moving all content to the right pane (leaving the left pane dedicated to functions and the trending topics list).[317] In March 2012, Twitter became available in Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew and Urdu, the first right-to-left language versions of the site. About 13,000 volunteers helped with translating the menu options.[318] In August 2012, beta support for Basque, Czech and Greek was added, making the site available in 33 different languages.[319]In September 2012, a new layout for profiles was introduced, with larger ""covers"" that could be customized with a custom header image, and a display of the user's recent photos posted.[320] The ""Discover"" tab was discontinued in April 2015,[321] and was succeeded on the mobile app by an ""Explore"" tab—which features trending topics and moments.[322]In September 2018, Twitter began to migrate selected web users to its progressive web app (based on its Twitter Lite experience for mobile web), reducing the interface to two columns. Migrations to this iteration of Twitter increased in April 2019, with some users receiving it with a modified layout.[323][324]In July 2019, Twitter officially released this redesign, with no further option to opt-out while logged in. It is designed to further-unify Twitter's user experience between the web and application versions, adopting a three-column layout with a sidebar containing links to common areas (including Explore), and features from the mobile version (such as multi-account support, and an opt-out for the ""top tweets"" mode on the timeline).[325][326]Outages  The Twitter fail whale error messageDuring an outage, Twitter users were at one time shown the ""fail whale"" error message image created by Yiying Lu,[327] illustrating eight orange birds using a net to hoist a whale from the ocean captioned ""Too many tweets! Please wait a moment and try again.""[328] Web designer and Twitter user Jen Simmons was the first to coin the term ""fail whale"" in a September 2007 tweet.[329][330] In a November 2013 WIRED interview Chris Fry, VP of Engineering at that time, noted that the company had taken the ""fail whale"" out of production as the platform was now more stable.[331]Twitter had approximately ninety-eight percent uptime in 2007 (or about six full days of downtime).[332] The downtime was particularly noticeable during events popular with the technology industry such as the 2008 Macworld Conference & Expokeynote address.[333][334]User accountsPrivacy, security and harassmentTwitter messages are public, but users can also send private ""direct messages"".[335] Information about who has chosen to follow an account and who a user has chosen to follow is also public, though accounts can be changed to ""protected"" which limits this information (and all tweets) to approved followers.[336] Twitter collects personally identifiable information about its users and shares it with third parties as specified in its privacy policy. The service also reserves the right to sell this information as an asset if the company changes hands.[337] While Twitter displays no advertising, advertisers can target users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads[338] directed specifically to the user.
A security vulnerability was reported on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith. Since Twitter used the phone number of the sender of an SMS message as authentication, malicious users could update someone else's status page by using SMS spoofing.[339] The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim's account. Within a few weeks of this discovery, Twitter introduced an optional personal identification number (PIN) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages.[340]On January 5, 2009, 33 high-profile Twitter accounts were compromised after a Twitter administrator's password was guessed by a dictionary attack.[341] Some of the compromised accounts sent falsified tweets, including drug-related messages.[342]Twitter launched the beta version of their ""Verified Accounts"" service on June 11, 2009, allowing people with public profiles to announce their account name. The home pages of these accounts display a badge indicating their status.[343]In May 2010, a bug was discovered by İnci Sözlük that could allow a Twitter user to force others to follow them without the other users' consent or knowledge. For example, comedian Conan O'Brien's account, which had been set to follow only one person, was changed to receive nearly 200 malicious subscriptions.[344]In response to Twitter's security breaches, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought charges against the service; the charges were settled on June 24, 2010. This was the first time the FTC had taken action against a social network for security lapses. The settlement requires Twitter to take a number of steps to secure users' private information, including maintenance of a ""comprehensive information security program"" to be independently audited biannually.[345]On December 14, 2010, the United States Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information for accounts registered to or associated with WikiLeaks.[346] Twitter decided to notify its users and said in a statement, ""... it's our policy to notify users about law enforcement and governmental requests for their information, unless we are prevented by law from doing so.""[335]A ""MouseOver"" exploit occurred on September 21, 2010, when an XSS Worm became active on Twitter. When a user held the mouse cursor over blacked-out parts of a tweet, the worm within the script would automatically open links and re-post itself on the reader's account.[347] The exploit was then re-used to post pop-up ads and links to pornographic sites. The origin of the worm is unclear, but Pearce H. Delphin (known on Twitter as @zzap) and a Scandinavian developer, Magnus Holm, both claim to have modified a related exploit found by another user (possibly Masato Kinugawa) who was using it to create coloured Tweets.[348] Kinugawa, a Japanese developer, reported the XSS vulnerability to Twitter on August 14. Later, when he found it was exploitable again, he created the account 'RainbowTwtr' and used it to post coloured messages.[348] Delphin says he exposed the security flaw by tweeting a JavaScriptfunction for ""onMouseOver"",[348] and Holm later created and posted the XSS Worm that automatically re-tweeted itself.[347] Security firm Sophos reported that the virus was spread by people doing it for ""fun and games"", but noted it could be exploited by cybercriminals.[347] Twitter issued a statement on their status blog at 13:50 UTC that ""The exploit is fully patched.""[347][349] Twitter representative Carolyn Penner said no charges would be pressed.[350]In May 2011, a claimant known as ""CTB"" in the case of CTB v Twitter Inc. took action against Twitter at the High Court of Justice of England and Wales,[351] requesting that the company release details of account holders. This followed gossip posted on Twitter about professional footballer Ryan Giggs's private life. This led to the 2011 British privacy injunctions controversy and the ""super-injunction"".[352] Tony Wang, the head of Twitter in Europe, said that people who do ""bad things"" on the site would need to defend themselves under the laws of their own jurisdiction in the event of controversy and that the site would hand over information about users to the authorities when it was legally required to do so.[353] He also suggested that Twitter would accede to a UK court order to divulge names of users responsible for ""illegal activity"" on the site.[354]Twitter acquired Dasient, a startup that offers malware protection for businesses, in January 2012. Twitter announced plans to use Dasient to help remove hateful advertisers on the website.[355] Twitter also offered a feature which would allow tweets to be removed selectively by country, before deleted tweets used to be removed in all countries.[356][357] The first use of the policy was to block the account of German neo-Nazi group Besseres Hannover on October 18, 2012.[358] The policy was used again the following day to remove anti-Semitic French tweets with the hashtag #unbonjuif (""a good Jew"").[359] In February 2012, a third-partypublic-key encryptionapp (written in Python and partially funded by a grant from the Shuttleworth Foundation[360]) for private messaging in Twitter, CrypTweet, was released.[361] A month later Twitter announced it would implement the ""Do Not Track"" privacy option, a cookie-blocking feature found in Mozilla's Firefox browser. The ""Do Not Track"" feature works only on sites that have agreed to the service.[362]In August 2012, it was reported that there was a market in fake Twitter followers used to increase politicians' and celebrities' apparent popularity.[363] The black market for the fake followers, known as ""bots"", has been linked to ""nearly every politically linked account from the White House to Congress to the 2016 campaign trail"". In June 2014, POLITICO analyzed Twitter handles with the highest rates of fake followers: U.S. President Barack Obama with 46.8 percent, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz with 35.1 percent, and Senator John McCain with 23.6 percent. The culprits working to generate the fake followers, or ""bots"", included campaign workers or friends of political candidates. One site offered 1,000 fake followers for $20. The people creating the ""bots"" were often from Eastern Europe and Asia.[364][365] In 2013, two Italian researchers calculated 10 percent of total accounts on Twitter were ""bots"" although other estimates have placed the figure even higher.[366]After a number of high-profile hacks of official accounts, including those of the Associated Press and The Guardian,[367] in April 2013, Twitter announced a two-factor login verification as an added measure against hacking.[368] In August 2013, Twitter announced plans to introduce a ""report abuse"" button for all versions of the site following uproar, including a petition with 100,000 signatures, over Tweets that included rape and death threats to historian Mary Beard, feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez and the member of parliament Stella Creasy.[369][370][371] Followed the sharing of images showing the killing of American journalist James Foley in 2014, Twitter said that in certain cases it would delete pictures of people who had died after requests from family members and ""authorized individuals"".[372][373]Twitter announced new reporting and blocking policies in December 2014,[374][375][376][377] including a blocking mechanism devised by Randi Harper, a target of GamerGate.[378][379][380] In February 2015, CEO Dick Costolo said he was 'frankly ashamed' at how poorly Twitter handled trolling and abuse, and admitted Twitter had lost users as a result.[381]In 2015, following updated terms of service and privacy policy, Twitter users outside the United States were legally served by the Ireland-based Twitter International Company instead of Twitter, Inc. The change made these users subject to Irish and European Union data protection laws[382]In 2016, Twitter announced the creation of the Twitter Trust & Safety Council to help ""ensure that people feel safe expressing themselves on Twitter."" The council's inaugural members included 50 organizations and individuals.[383]On May 5, 2018, Twitter sent out an update/mail to every customer regarding a bug that stored passwords unmasked in an internal log. According to them the investigation showed no indications of breach or misuse but recommended everyone to change their password anyway.[384]On May 13, 2019, Twitter disclosed that they had discovered a bug that accidentally shared location data from iOS devices to an advertiser. They assured that the data was not retained and that the bug was fixed.[385][386][387]On December 20, 2019, Twitter fixed a security vulnerability in its Android app that could allow a hacker to take over a user's account and send tweets or direct messages as well as see private account info.[388][389]The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has faced criticism for the behavior of some of his supporters online but has deflected such criticism, suggesting that ""Russians"" were impersonating people claiming to be ""Bernie Bro"" supporters.[390] Twitter rejected Sanders' suggestion that Russia could be responsible for the bad reputation of his supporters. A Twitter spokesperson told CNBC: ""Using technology and human review in concert, we proactively monitor Twitter to identify attempts at platform manipulation and mitigate them. As is standard, if we have reasonable evidence of state-backed information operations, we’ll disclose them following our thorough investigation to our public archive — the largest of its kind in the industry.""[391]On April 8, 2020, Twitter announced that users outside of the European Economic Area or United Kingdom (thus subject to GDPR) will no longer be allowed to opt out of sharing ""mobile app advertising measurements"" to Twitter third-party partners.[392]On 9 October 2020, Twitter took additional steps to counter misleading campaigns ahead of the 2020 US Election. Twitter’s new temporary update encouraged users to “add their own commentary” before retweeting a tweet, by making ‘quoting tweet’ a mandatory feature instead of optional. The social network giant aimed at generating context and encouraging the circulation of more thoughtful content.[393]Suspect and contested accountsSee also: Deplatforming and Twitter suspensionsIn January 2016, Twitter was sued by the widow of a U.S. man killed in the 2015 Amman shooting attack, claiming that allowing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) to continually use the platform, including direct messages in particular,[394] constituted the provision of material support to a terrorist organization, which is illegal under U.S. federal law. Twitter disputed the claim, stating that ""violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on Twitter and, like other social networks, our rules make that clear.""[395][396] The lawsuit was dismissed by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, upholding the Section 230 safe harbor, which dictates that the operators of an interactive computer service are not liable for the content published by its users.[396][397] The lawsuit was revised in August 2016, providing comparisons to other telecommunications devices.[394]Twitter suspended multiple parody accounts that satirized Russian politics in May 2016, sparking protests and raising questions about where the company stands on freedom of speech.[398] Following public outcry, Twitter restored the accounts the next day without explaining why the accounts had been suspended.[399] The same day, Twitter, along with Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, jointly agreed to a European Union code of conduct obligating them to review ""[the] majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech"" posted on their services within 24 hours.[400] In August 2016, Twitter stated that it had banned 235,000 accounts over the past six months, bringing the overall number of suspended accounts to 360,000 accounts in the past year, for violating policies banning use of the platform to promote extremism.[401]On May 10, 2019, Twitter announced that they suspended 166,513 accounts for promoting terrorism in the July–December 2018 period, stating there was a steady decrease in terrorist groups trying to use the platform owing to its ""zero-tolerance policy enforcement"". According to Vijaya Gadde, Legal, Policy and Trust and Safety Lead at Twitter, there was a reduction of 19% terror related tweets from the previous reporting period (January–June 2018).[402][403][404][405][406]Similarly, Twitter banned 7,000 accounts and limited 150,000 more that had ties to QAnon on July 21, 2020. The bans and limits came after QAnon-related accounts began harassing other users through practices of swarming or brigading, coordinated attacks on these individuals through multiple accounts in the weeks prior. Those accounts limited by Twitter will not appear in searches nor be promoted in other Twitter functions. Twitter said they will continue to ban or limit accounts as necessary, with their support account stating ""We will permanently suspend accounts Tweeting about these topics that we know are engaged in violations of our multi-account policy, coordinating abuse around individual victims, or are attempting to evade a previous suspension"".[407]As of July 30, 2020, Twitter will block URLs in tweets that point to external websites that contain malicious content (such as malware and phishing content) as well or hate speech, speech encouraging violence, terrorism, child sexual exploitation, breaches of privacy, and other similar content that is already banned as part of the content of tweets on the site. Users that frequently point to such sites may have their accounts suspended. Twitter said this was to bring their policy in line to prevent users from bypassing their tweet content restrictions by simply linking to the banned content.[408]Malicious and fake accountsBetween January and late July 2017, Twitter had identified and shut down over 7,000 fake accounts created by Iranian influence operations.[409]In May 2018, in response to scrutiny over the misuse of Twitter by those seeking to maliciously influence elections, Twitter announced that it would partner with the nonprofit organization Ballotpedia to add special labels verifying the authenticity of political candidates running for election in the U.S.[410][411]In December 2019, Twitter removed 5,929 accounts for violating their manipulation policies. The company investigated and attributed these accounts to a single state-run information operation, which originated in Saudi Arabia. The accounts were reported to be a part of a larger group of 88,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior. However, Twitter did not disclose all of them as some could possibly be legitimate accounts taken over through hacking.[412]Twitter botsMain article: Twitter botA Twitter bot is a computer program that automatically posts on Twitter, they are programmed to tweet, retweet, and follow other accounts. According to a recent report, there were 20 million, fewer than 5%, of accounts on Twitter that were fraudulent in 2013. These fake accounts are often used to build large follower populations quickly for advertisers, while others respond to tweets that include a certain word or phrase.[413] Twitter's wide-open application programming interface and cloud servers make it possible for twitterbots' existence within the social networking site.[414]EffectsTwitterbots are capable of influencing public opinion about culture, products, and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication.[415]The New York Times states, ""They have sleep-wake cycles so their fakery is more convincing, making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs.""[416] The tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing, all of which depends on the intention of the person purchasing or creating the bot. The social implications these Twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the ScienceDirect Journal. Looking at the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the journal notes, ""people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media, treating them as if they were real people or real places."" The study concluded that Twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere.[417] While technological advances have enabled the ability of successful Human-Computer Interaction, the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the Twitter realm. Benign Twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular, push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation, spam and/or slander.[418]In addition to content-generating bots, users can purchase followers, favorites, retweets, and comments on various websites that cater to expanding a user's image through the accumulation of followers. With more followers, users' profiles gain more attention, thus increasing their popularity.[419] Generating Web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability.[420] With Twitterbots, users are able to create the illusion of ""buzz"" on their site by obtaining followers from services such as Swenzy and underground suppliers who operate bot farms or click farms.[415][420] The companies that facilitate this service create fake Twitter accounts that follow a number of people, some of these Twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it seem like they are real. This practice of obtaining mass amounts of twitterbots as followers is not permitted on Twitter.[421] The emphasis on followers and likes as a measure of social capital has urged people to extend their circle to weak and latent ties to promote the idea of popularity for celebrities, politicians, musicians, public figures, and companies alike.[422] According to The New York Times, bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections, influence the stock market, public appeal, and attack governments.[423]DevelopersTwitter is recognized for having one of the most open and powerful developer APIs of any major technology company.[424] Developer interest in Twitter began immediately following its launch, prompting the company to release the first version of its public API in September 2006.[425] The API quickly became iconic as a reference implementation for public REST APIs and is widely cited in programming tutorials.[426]From 2006 until 2010, Twitter's developer platform experienced strong growth and a highly favorable reputation. Developers built upon the public API to create the first Twitter mobile phone clients as well as the first URL shortener. Between 2010 and 2012, however, Twitter made a number of decisions that were received unfavorably by the developer community.[427] In 2010, Twitter mandated that all developers adopt OAuth authentication with just 9 weeks of notice.[428] Later that year, Twitter launched its own URL shortener, in direct competition with some of its most well-known 3rd-party developers.[429] And in 2012, Twitter introduced strict usage limits for its API, ""completely crippling"" some developers.[430] While these moves successfully increased the stability and security of the service, they were broadly perceived as hostile to developers, causing them to lose trust in the platform.[431]In an effort to reset its relationship with developers, Twitter acquired Crashlytics on January 28, 2013 for over US$100 million, its largest acquisition to date.[432] Twitter committed to continue supporting and expanding the service.[433]In October 2014, Twitter announced Fabric, a suite of mobile developer tools built around Crashlytics.[434] Fabric brought together Crashlytics, Answers (mobile app analytics), Beta (mobile app distribution), Digits (mobile app identity and authentication services), MoPub, and TwitterKit (login with Twitter and Tweet display functionality) into a single, modular SDK, allowing developers to pick and choose which features they needed while guaranteeing ease of installation and compatibility. By building Fabric on top of Crashlytics, Twitter was able to take advantage of Crashlytics' large adoption and device footprint to rapidly scale usage of MoPub and TwitterKit. Fabric reached active distribution across 1 billion mobile devices just 8 months after its launch.[435]In early 2016, Twitter announced that Fabric was installed on more than 2 billion active devices and used by more than 225,000 developers. Fabric is recognized as the #1 most popular crash reporting and also the #1 mobile analytics solution among the top 200 iOS apps, beating out Google Analytics, Flurry, and MixPanel.[436][437]Innovators patent agreementOn April 17, 2012, Twitter announced it would implement an ""Innovators Patent Agreement"" which would obligate Twitter to only use its patents for defensive purposes[clarify]. The agreement went into effect in 2012.[438]Open sourceTwitter has a history of both using and releasing open source software while overcoming technical challenges of their service.[439] A page in their developer documentation thanks dozens of open source projects which they have used, from revision control software like Git to programming languages such as Ruby and Scala.[440] Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard Scala framework for creating distributed datastores, the distributed graph database FlockDB, the Finagle library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients, the TwUI user interface framework for iOS, and the Bower client-side package manager.[441] The popular Twitter Bootstrap web design library was also started at Twitter and is the second most popular repository on GitHub.[442]Society  Dorsey (left) said after a Twitter Town Hall with Barack Obama held in July 2011, that Twitter received over 110,000 #AskObama tweets.[443]Main article: Twitter usageUsageProtestersTwitter has been used for a variety of purposes in many industries and scenarios. For example, it has been used to organize protests, sometimes referred to as ""Twitter Revolutions"",[444] which include the protests over the 2009 Moldovan election, the 2009 student protests in Austria, the 2009 Gaza–Israel conflict, the 2009 Iranian green revolution, the 2010 Toronto G20 protests, the 2010 Bolivarian Revolution, the 2010 Stuttgart21 protests in Germany, the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, 2011 England riots, the 2011 United States Occupy movement, the 2011 anti-austerity movement in Spain, the 2011 Aganaktismenoi movements in Greece, the 2011 demonstration in Rome, the 2011 Wisconsin labor protests, the 2012 Gaza–Israel conflict, the 2013 protests in Brazil, and the 2013 Gezi Park protests in Turkey.[445] A result of the Iranian election protests saw the government of Iran block Twitter in censorship.[446]The service is also used as a form of civil disobedience: In 2010, users expressed outrage over the Twitter Joke Trial by copying a controversial joke about bombing an airport and attaching the hashtag #IAmSpartacus, a reference to the film Spartacus (1960) and a sign of solidarity and support to a man controversially prosecuted after posting a tweet joking about bombing an airport if they canceled his flight. #IAmSpartacus became the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide.[447] Another case of civil disobedience happened in the 2011 British privacy injunction debate, where several celebrities who had taken out anonymized injunctions were identified by thousands of users in protest to traditional journalism being censored.[448]During the Arab Spring in early 2011, the number of hashtags mentioning the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt increased.[449] A study by the Dubai School of Government found that only 0.26% of the Egyptian population, 0.1% of the Tunisian population and 0.04% of the Syrian population are active on Twitter.[450]GovernmentsAccording to documents leaked by Edward Snowden and published in July 2014, the United Kingdom's GCHQ has a tool named BIRDSONG for ""automated posting of Twitter updates"", and a tool named BIRDSTRIKE for ""Twitter monitoring and profile collection"".[451][452]During the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, Twitter suspended a core group of 1,000 ""fake"" accounts and an associated network of 200,000 accounts for operating a disinformation campaign that was linked to the Chinese government. In their announcement, Twitter released two data sets detailing the core group's account activity.[453][454][455]Geng Shuang, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, did not comment on the suspensions but suggested that the activity could be attributed to overseas Chinese citizens.[456][457]On June 12, 2020, Twitter suspended over 7,000 accounts from Turkey because those accounts were fake profiles, designed to support the Turkish president and were managed by a central authority. The Turkey's communication director said that the decision was illogical, biased and politically motivated.[458]Censorship and moderationMain articles: Censorship of Twitter, Deplatforming, and Twitter suspensionsTwitter is banned completely in Iran, China and North Korea,[459] and has been intermittently blocked in numerous countries including Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, Venezuela and Turkmenistan on different bases.[460][461][462][463][464] In 2016, Twitter cooperated with the Israeli government to remove certain content originating outside Israel from tweets seen in Israel.[465] In the 11th biannual transparency report published on September 19, 2017, Twitter said that Turkey was the first among countries where about 90 percent of removal requests came from, followed by Russia, France and Germany.[466] Twitter stated that between July 1 and December 31, 2018, ""We received legal demands relating to 27,283 accounts from 47 different countries, including Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, and Slovenia for the first time.""[467] As part of evidence to a US Senate Enquiry, the company admitted that their systems ""detected and hid"" several hundred thousand tweets relating to the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak.[468] During the curfew in Jammu and Kashmir after revocation of its autonomous status on August 5, 2019, the Indian government approached Twitter to block accounts accused of spreading anti-India content;[469] by October 25, nearly one million tweets had been removed as a result.[470]Hashtag suppressionAfter claims in the media that the hashtags #wikileaks and #occupywallstreet were being censored because they did not show up on the site's list of trending topics, Twitter responded by stating that it does not censor hashtags unless they contain obscenities.[471][472][473]Trust & Safety CouncilThe announcement of Twitter's ""Trust & Safety Council"" was met with objection from parts of its userbase.[474][475] Critics accused the member organizations of being heavily skewed towards ""the restriction of hate speech"" and a Reason article expressed concern that ""there’s not a single uncompromising anti-censorship figure or group on the list"".[476][477]Moderation of tweetsAt the start of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, numerous tweets reported false medical information related to the pandemic. Twitter announced a new policy in which they would label tweets containing misinformation going forward.[96]  The two tweets on May 26, 2020 from President Trump that Twitter had marked ""potentially misleading"" (inserting the blue warning icon and ""Get the facts..."" language) that led to the executive orderShortly afterwards United States President Donald Trump had used his Twitter account on May 26, 2020 to issue a statement related to possible fraud associated with mail-in voting ahead of the upcoming 2020 primary elections. Twitter moderators used the aforementioned tools to mark Trump's tweets as ""potentially misleading"" and added linked to a dedicated page with additional articles from other news sources on mail-in voting, the first time they had marked Trump's tweets as such.[478] Trump, who had previously alleged Twitter, and other technology companies, have an anti-conservative bias,[479] announced his intention to enact regulations to take action against Twitter. Two days later, on May 28, 2020, Trump signed ""Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship""[480] aimed to impact the protections of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act which Twitter and other social media sites have to avoid liability for dealing with moderation of user content on their platforms.[481][482][483]Around this time, the killing of George Floyd, an African-American, in an incident involving four white Minneapolis Police Department officers on May 25, sparked racially-driven riots in the city that turned violent by the evening of May 28. Trump tweeted his opinion on the violent protests, stating he had spoken to state governor Tim Walz about bringing National Guard forces to help calm the situation, but concluded the tweet by saying ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter, after internal consultation with its review boards and management, opted to add a ""public interest notice""[484] to the tweet,[485] warning users it ""glorified violence"" and while they normally would have removed such posts in the past, they ""have kept the Tweet on Twitter because it is important that the public still be able to see the Tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance.""[486] Twitter users were still able to view Trump's tweet if they chose to click on it,[487] but could not like or retweet it without their own comment.
Main article: Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theoryGoing into the late months of the 2020 United States presidential election, Twitter continued to mark several tweets from Trump, other conservative lawmakers, and various alt- and far-right users with similar ""misinformaiton"" labels, or taking other actions when these tweets violated their user policy. On October 14, 2020 the New York Post published a story containing allegations about Hunter Biden, son of Joe Biden. Twitter and Facebook both implemented measures on their platforms to prevent sharing of the New York Post article, with Twitter doing so according to their Hacked Materials Policy and Facebook per a policy that ""in many countries, including in the U.S., if we have signals that a piece of content is false, we temporarily reduce its distribution pending review by a third-party fact-checker.""[488][489][490] Commentators from varied political backgrounds criticized the actions taken by Facebook and Twitter, arguing that they could have amplified disinformation due to the Streisand effect.[491]After the election, in which Biden had been determined to be the winner, Trump and several of his allies continued to dispute the results through legal actions, while continuing to assert there was fraud and other inconsistencies on Twitter. Twitter continued to apply their moderation as they had done before. Trump continued to threaten revoking Section 230 due to actions by Twitter and other social media companies by demanding Congress include its revoking in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.[492] Separately, new social media companies such as Parler were created to cater specifically to conservative and right-leaning voices that felt that Twitter and other social media companies were suppressing their voice.[493]ImpactInstant, short, and frequent communicationIn May 2008, The Wall Street Journal wrote that social networking services such as Twitter ""elicit mixed feelings in the technology-savvy people who have been their early adopters. Fans say they are a good way to keep in touch with busy friends. But some users are starting to feel too connected, as they grapple with check-in messages at odd hours, higher cellphone bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what they're having for dinner.""[494] The following year, John C. Dvorak described Twitter as ""the new CB radio"".[495]Emergency useA practical use for Twitter's real-time functionality is as an effective de facto emergency communication system for breaking news. It was neither intended nor designed for high-performance communication, but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication was not lost on the creators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes.[496]Another practical use that is being studied is Twitter's ability to track epidemics and how they spread.[497]Additionally Twitter serves as sensor for natural disasters such as bush fires and earthquakes.[498][499]EducationTwitter has been adopted as a communication and learning tool in educational and research[500] settings mostly in colleges and universities.[501][502] It has been used as a backchannel to promote student interactions, especially in large-lecture courses.[503] Research has found that using Twitter in college courses helps students communicate with each other and faculty, promotes informal learning, allows shy students a forum for increased participation, increases student engagement, and improves overall course grades.[504][505][506]Twitter has been an increasingly growing in the field of education, as an effective tool that can be used to encourage learning and idea, or knowledge sharing, in and outside the classroom.[507] By using or creating hashtags, students and educators are able to communicate under specific categories of their choice, to enhance and promote education. A broad example of a hashtag used in education is ""edchat"", to communicate with other teachers, and people using that hashtag. Once teachers find someone they want to talk to, they can either direct message the person, or narrow down the hashtag to make the topic of the conversation more specific using hashtags for scichat (science), engchat (English), sschat (social studies).[507]In a 2011 study, researchers found that young peoples use of Twitter helped to improve relationships with teachers, encourage interactive learning, and ultimately lead to high grades.[507] In the same study it was found that out of a group of 158 educators, 92% agreed that the reason they use Twitter is because of how user friendly it is,[507] another 86% agreed that they started and continue using Twitter because of how easy it is to learn, and finally,[507] 93% said they use Twitter because it is free. People found that sifting through large amounts of data is challenging, however, with the simple nature of Twitter large amount of information became easily accessible.[508] Much of this simplicity comes from the use of the hashtag, and the intuitive nature of how Twitter as a microblogging site operates.[508] These features help to promote education outside the classroom in a global setting where students and educators are easily able to create, connect, and share knowledge. This ultimately promotes growth and learning among students and educators, not just in the classroom, but virtually and around the world.
Public figuresTech writer Bruce Sterling commented in 2007 that using Twitter for ""literate communication"" is ""about as likely as firing up a CB radio and hearing some guy recite the Iliad"".[509] In September 2008, the journalist Clive Thompson mused in a New York Times Magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into ""a new, supermetabolic extreme—the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrity-addled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating and ought to be shared with the world"".[510] One of the earliest documented forms of celebrity-related Twitter-like disclosures dates from 1980, when real estate mogul William Desmond Ryan made round-the-clock press releases about his relationship with comedian Phyllis Diller, even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis.[511] Conversely, Vancouver Sun columnist Steve Dotto opined that part of Twitter's appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints,[512] and Jonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that ""the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful.""[513] In that same vein, and with Sigmund Freud in mind, political communications expert Matthew Auer observed that well-crafted tweets by public figures often deliberately mix trivial and serious information so as to appeal to all three parts of the reader’s personality: the id, ego, and superego.[514]The poets Mira Gonzalez and Tao Lin published a book titled Selected Tweets featuring selections of their tweets over some eight years. The book was designed to look like a small bible.[515]The novelist Rick Moody wrote a short story for Electric Literature called ""Some Contemporary Characters,"" composed entirely of tweets.[516]In 2009, Nielsen Online reported that Twitter had a user-retention rate of forty percent. Many people stop using the service after a month; therefore the site may potentially reach only about ten percent of all Internet users.[517] In 2009, Twitter won the ""Breakout of the Year"" Webby Award.[518][519] During a February 2009 discussion on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition, the journalist Daniel Schorr stated that Twitter accounts of events lacked rigorous fact-checking and other editorial improvements. In response, Andy Carvin gave Schorr two examples of breaking news stories that played out on Twitter and said users wanted first-hand accounts and sometimes debunked stories.[520] On November 29, 2009, Twitter was named the Word of the Year by the Global Language Monitor, declaring it ""a new form of social interaction"".[521]Time magazine acknowledged its growing level of influence in its 2010 Time 100; to determine the influence of people, it used a formula based on famous social networking sites, Twitter and Facebook. The list ranges from Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey to Lady Gaga and Ashton Kutcher.[522][523] The U.S. government, seeing social media's role in the 2010 Arab Spring revolts, covertly developed a Cuban alternative to Twitter called ZunZuneo as part of a long-term strategy to ""stir unrest"". The service was active from 2010 to 2012.[524]During the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared at the London Olympic Stadium in person,[525] Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, tweeted ""This is for everyone"",[526] which was instantly spelled out in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the 80,000 people in the audience.[525]World leaders  Donald Trump's twitter postWorld leaders and their diplomats have taken note of Twitter's rapid expansion and have been increasingly utilizing Twitter diplomacy, the use of Twitter to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens. US Ambassador to Russia, Michael A. McFaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy. He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011, posting in English and Russian.[527] On October 24, 2014, Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet to mark the opening of the London Science Museum's Information Age exhibition.[528] A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the United Nations had established government Twitter accounts.[529] The same study also found that those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world leaders and their foreign ministers, with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers.[529]According to an analysis of accounts, the heads of state of 125 countries and 139 other leading politicians have Twitter accounts that have between them sent more than 350,000 tweets and have almost 52 million followers. However, only 30 of these do their own tweeting, more than 80 do not subscribe to other politicians and many do not follow any accounts.[530]Donald Trump has used Twitter as a method of providing ideas and information during his presidential campaign in 2016, the transitional period and as US President. A study performed at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology showed his tweets from these different time periods and through analysis of his tweets, the professors found that President Trump uses a mode called ""forensic mode"" the most often in his tweets. This is described as a quick reactive usage, as they found he often used Twitter to show his judgment of the events that occurred regarding both his allies and his enemies.[531] After his election to the presidency he tweeted this ""forensic-style"" tweet, ""Just had a very open and successful election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very Unfair!"".[532]In a study done at New York University in 2015, an analysis and comparison of the Twitter accounts of Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, found observations showing the goals of each candidate's Twitter during their respective primary elections. Some comparisons that were made were the use of Aristotle's theory of Rhetoric. The research found that Donald Trump used pathos, the appeal to emotion, in his rhetoric; Bernie Sanders tended to use ethos and logos for his Twitter; Hillary Clinton tended to use logos and pathos to try to convey her values, and Jeb Bush shows that he uses a mix of all three on his account. The study also looked at the media response to the tweets during the election. The study found that the tweets became more persuasive for the candidates if the media put the tweets in front of more viewers, versus less powerful if they were only visible to those already on Twitter. In that way, presidential candidates who had their tweets covered more in the news were able to get their message to more potential voters.[533]ReligionMore than twenty Roman Catholic cardinals manage active Twitter accounts,[534] nine of whom were cardinal electors for the 2013 Papal conclave.[535]Pope Benedict XVI's Twitter account was set up in 2012. As of April 2016, his successor, Pope Francis, has 9.06 million followers of his Twitter account (@Pontifex).[536]In a 2015 European Foundation for Democracy-European Policy Centre policy dialogue panel in Brussels, Mark Wallace, CEO of the ""CounterExtremism Project"" and former U.S ambassador to the United Nations, said: ""Twitter is currently the 'gateway drug' for those seeking to recruit fighters for Islamicterrorism and this must be stopped.""[537]Fines, Penalties and SanctionsViolation of campaign finance lawsIn October 2020 Twitter was fined $100,000 by Washington State for violating that state's campaign finance disclosure rules. A judgement filed on October 13, 2020 found ""the social media platform failed to maintain public inspection records of nearly $200,000 paid to it for political ads in violation of state law"" according to Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson.[538]TelevisionTwitter is increasingly used for TV to be more interactive.[539] This effect is sometimes referred to as the second screen,[540] ""virtual watercooler"" or social television—the practice has been called ""chatterboxing"".[541] Twitter has been successfully used to encourage people to watch live TV events, such as the Oscars, the Super Bowl[542] and the MTV Video Music Awards; however this strategy has proven less effective with regularly scheduled TV shows.[543] Such direct cross-promotions have been banned from French television due to regulations against secret advertising.[544]In December 2012, Twitter and Nielsen entered a multi-year agreement to produce social TV ratings, which are expected to be commercially available for the fall 2013 season as the Nielsen Twitter TV Rating.[545][546]Advertising Age said Twitter had become the new TV Guide.[547] Then in February 2013, Twitter acquired Bluefin Labs for an estimated US$50 million to $100 million. Founded in 2008 at the MIT Media Lab, Bluefin is a data miner whose analysis tells which brands (e.g., TV shows and companies) are chatted about the most in social media.[545][546][548] MIT Technology Review said that Bluefin gives Twitter part of the US$72 billion television advertising market.[549]In May 2013, it launched Twitter Amplify—an advertising product for media and consumer brands.[550] With Amplify, Twitter runs video highlights from major live broadcasts, with advertisers' names and messages playing before the clip.[551] In October 2013, Comcast announced that it had partnered with Twitter to implement its ""See It"" feature within the service, allowing posts promoting programs on selected NBCUniversal channels to contain direct links to TV Everywhere streaming to the program. On launch, the concept was limited to NBCUniversal channels and Xfinity cable television subscribers.[552]In an attempt to compete with Twitter's leadership in TV, Facebook introduced a number of features in 2013 to drive conversation about TV including hashtags, verified profiles and embeddable posts. It also opened up new data visualization APIs for TV news and other media outlets, enabling them to search for a word and see a firehose of public posts that mention it as well as show how many people mentioned a word in both public and private posts during a set time frame, with a demographic breakdown of the age, gender, and location of these people.[553] In January 2014, Facebook announced a partnership with UK-based social TV analytics company SecondSync which saw the social network make its social TV available outside the company for the first time. Facebook struck the partnership to help marketers understand how people are using the social network to talk about topics such as TV.[554] However, Twitter responded by acquiring SecondSync and Parisian social TV firm Mesagraph three months later. These acquisitions, as well as a partnership with research company Kantar (which it had been working with to develop a suite of analytics tools for the British TV industry since August 2013) strengthened Twitter's dominance of the ""second screen"" – TV viewers using tablets and smartphones to share their TV experience on social media. With the additional analytic tools, Twitter was able to improve the firm's offering to advertisers, allowing them to, for instance, only promote a tweet onto the timelines of users who were watching a certain programme.[555]By February 2014, all four major U.S. TV networks had signed up to the Amplify program, bringing a variety of premium TV content onto the social platform in the form of in-tweet real-time video clips.[556] In March 2014, ITV became the first major broadcaster in the UK to sign up to Twitter Amplify[557] and Twitter introduced one-tap video playback across its mobile apps to further enhance the consumer experience.[558]In June 2014, Twitter acquired its Amplify partner in the U.S., SnappyTV.[559] In Europe, Twitter's Amplify partner is London-based Grabyo, which has also struck numerous deals with broadcasters and rights holders[77] to share video content across Facebook and Twitter.[560] In July 2017, Twitter announced that it would wind down SnappyTV as a separate company, and integrate its features into the Media Studio suite on Twitter.[561]StatisticsUser accounts with large follower baseMain article: List of most-followed Twitter accountsAs of 1 August 2020[update], the ten Twitter accounts with the most followers were:[562]Rank

The resulting photo of twelve celebrities broke the previous retweet record within forty minutes, and was retweeted over 1.8 million times in the first hour.[566][567][568] By the end of the ceremony it had been retweeted over 2 million times; less than 24 hours later, it had been retweeted over 2.8 million times.[565][566] As of 18 March 2014[update], it has been retweeted over 3.4 million times.[565] The group selfie effort was parodied by Lego, and Matt Groening with The Simpsons.[569][570] It beat the previous record, 778,801, which was held by Barack Obama, following his victory in the 2012 presidential election.[568][571][572] On May 9, 2017, Ellen's record was broken by Carter Wilkerson (@carterjwm) by collecting nearly 3.5 million retweets in a little over a month.[573]According to Guinness World Records, the fastest pace to a million followers was set by actor Robert Downey Jr. in 23 hours and 22 minutes in April 2014.[574] This record was later broken by Caitlyn Jenner, who joined the site on June 1, 2015, and amassed a million followers in just 4 hours and 3 minutes.
The most tweeted moment in the history of Twitter occurred on August 2, 2013; during a Japanese television airing of the Studio Ghibli film Castle in the Sky, fans simultaneously tweeted the word balse (バルス)—the incantation for a destruction spell used during its climax, after it was uttered in the film. There was a global peak of 143,199 tweets in one second, beating the previous record of 33,388.[575][576]The most discussed event in Twitter history occurred on October 24, 2015; the hashtag (""#ALDubEBTamangPanahon"") for Tamang Panahon, a live special episode of the Filipino variety show Eat Bulaga! at the Philippine Arena, centering on its popular on-air couple AlDub, attracted 41 million tweets.[577][578] The most-discussed sporting event in Twitter history was the 2014 FIFA World Cup semi-final between Brazil and Germany on July 8, 2014.[579]On the day of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Twitter proved to be the largest source of breaking news, with over 40 million tweets sent that day.[580]See also.mw-parser-output .portal{border:solid #aaa 1px;padding:0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tleft{margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tright{margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul{display:table;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0.1em;max-width:175px;background:#f9f9f9;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li{display:table-row}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:first-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:last-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle}Companies portalAmbient awarenessComparison of microblogging servicesList of mergers and acquisitions by TwitterTimeline of social mediaTwitteratureReferences^https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/14/twitter-names-googles-omid-kordestani-as-its-new-executive-chairman/^https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2019/q3/Q3_19_InvestorFactSheet.pdf^ abDorsey, Jack (March 21, 2006).

"3 November 2020, at 20:19","In computer programming, a pure function is a function that has the following properties:[1][2]Its return value is the same for the same arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams from I/O devices).Its evaluation has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or I/O streams).Thus a pure function is a computational analogue of a mathematical function. Some authors, particularly from the imperative language community, use the term ""pure"" for all functions that just have the above property 2[3][4] (discussed below).
Contents1Examples1.1Pure functions1.2Impure functions2I/O in pure functions3Compiler optimizations4Unit testing5See also6References7External links

Examples[edit]Pure functions[edit]The following examples of C++ functions are pure:
floor, returning the floor of a number;max, returning the maximum of two values.the function f, defined asvoidf(){
  staticstd::atomic<unsignedint>x=0;
  ++x;}Although this code sample looks like it is not pure, it actually is. The value of x can be only observed inside other invocations of f(), and as f() does not communicate the value of x to its environment, it is indistinguishable from function void f() {} that does nothing. Note that x is std::atomic so that modifications from multiple threads executing f() concurrently do not result in a data race, which has undefined behavior in C and C++.Impure functions[edit]The following C++ functions are impure as they lack the above property 1:
because of return value variation with a non-local variableintf(){
  returnx;}For the same reason, e.g. the C++ library function sin() is not pure, since its result depends on the IEEE rounding mode which can be changed at runtime.because of return value variation with a mutable reference argumentintf(int*x){
  return*x;}because of inconsistent defined/undefined behavior:voidf(){
  staticintx=0;
  ++x;}Overflow of a signed integer is an undefined behavior per C++ specification. Also, if f() is called concurrently, the code exhibits a data race. Pure functions can fail or never return, but they must do this consistently (for the same input). However, f() may, or may not, fail, depending on whether the upper bound of allowed signed int value was reached or a data race happens, or not.The following C++ functions are impure as they lack the above property 2:
because of mutation of a local static variablevoidf(){
  staticintx=0;
  ++x;}because of mutation of a non-local variablevoidf(){
  ++x;}because of mutation of a mutable reference argumentvoidf(int*x){
  ++*x;}because of mutation of an output streamvoidf(){
  std::cout<<""Hello, world!""<<std::endl;}The following C++ functions are impure as they lack both the above properties 1 and 2:
because of return value variation with a local static variable and mutation of a local static variableintf(){
  staticintx=0;
  ++x;
  returnx;}because of return value variation with an input stream and mutation of an input streamintf(){
  intx=0;
  std::cin>>x;
  returnx;}I/O in pure functions[edit]I/O is inherently impure: input operations undermine referential transparency, and output operations create side effects. Nevertheless, there is a sense in which function can perform input or output and still be pure, if the sequence of operations on the relevant I/O devices is modeled explicitly as both an argument and a result, and I/O operations are taken to fail when the input sequence does not describe the operations actually taken since the program began execution.
The second point ensures that the only sequence usable as an argument must change with each I/O action; the first allows different calls to an I/O-performing function to return different results on account of the sequence arguments having changed.[5][6]The I/O monad is a programming idiom typically used to perform I/O in pure functional languages.
Compiler optimizations[edit]Functions that have just the above property 2 allow for compiler optimization techniques such as common subexpression elimination and loop optimization similar to arithmetic operators.[3] A C++ example is the length method, returning the size of a string, which depends on the memory contents where the string points to, therefore lacking the above property 1. Nevertheless, in a single-threaded environment, the following C++ code
std::strings=""Hello, world!"";inta[10]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};intl=0;

for(inti=0;i<10;++i){
  l+=s.length()+a[i];}can be optimized such that the value of s.length() is computed only once, before the loop.
In Fortran, the pure keyword can be used to declare a function to be just side-effect free (i.e. have just the above property 2).
Unit testing[edit]Since pure functions have the same return value for the same arguments, they are well suited to unit testing.

A function returns exactly the same result every time it's called with the same set of arguments. In other words a function has no state, nor can it access any external state. Every time you call it, it behaves like a newborn baby with blank memory and no knowledge of the external world. 2. A function has no side effects.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Find sources: ""Boilerplate code"" – news ·newspapers ·books ·scholar ·JSTOR  (May 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)In computer programming, boilerplate code or just boilerplate are sections of code that are repeated in multiple places with little to no variation. When using languages that are considered verbose, the programmer must write a lot of code to accomplish only minor functionality. Such code is called boilerplate.[1]The need for boilerplate can be reduced through high-level mechanisms such as metaprogramming (which has the computer automatically write the needed boilerplate code or insert it at compile time), convention over configuration (which provides good default values, reducing the need to specify program details in every project) and model-driven engineering (which uses models and model-to-code generators, eliminating the need for manual boilerplate code).
Contents1Origin2Preamble3In object-oriented programming3.1Method boilerplate4HTML5See also6References

Origin[edit]Further information: Boilerplate (text)The term arose from the newspaper business. Columns and other pieces that were distributed by print syndicates were sent to subscribing newspapers in the form of prepared printing plates. Because of their resemblance to the metal plates used in the making of boilers, they became known as ""boiler plates"", and their resulting text - ""boilerplate text"". As the stories that were distributed by boiler plates were usually ""fillers"" rather than ""serious"" news, the term became synonymous with unoriginal, repetitive text.[2][3]A related term is bookkeeping code, referring to code that is not part of the business logic but is interleaved with it in order to keep data structures updated or handle secondary aspects of the program.
Preamble[edit]One form of boilerplate consists of declarations which, while not part of the program logic or the language's essential syntax, are added to the start of a source file as a matter of custom. The following Perl example demonstrates boilerplate:
#!/usr/bin/perlusewarnings;usestrict;The first line is a shebang, which identifies the file as a Perl script that can be executed directly on the command line (on Unix/Linux systems.) The other two are pragmas turning on warnings and strict mode, which are mandated by fashionable Perl programming style.
This next example is a C/C++ programming language boilerplate, #include guard.
#ifndef MYINTERFACE_H#define MYINTERFACE_H

...

#endifThis checks, and sets up, a global flag to tell the compiler whether the file myinterface.h has already been included. As many interdepending files may be involved in the compilation of a module, this avoids processing the same header multiple times (which would lead to errors due to multiple definitions with the same name).
In object-oriented programming[edit]In object-oriented programs, classes are often provided with methods for getting and setting instance variables. The definitions of these methods can frequently be regarded as boilerplate. Although the code will vary from one class to another, it is sufficiently stereotypical in structure that it would be better generated automatically than written by hand. For example, in the following Java class representing a pet, almost all the code is boilerplate except for the declarations of Pet, name and owner:
publicclassPet{
    privateStringname;
    privatePersonowner;

    publicPet(Stringname,Personowner){
        this.name=name;
        this.owner=owner;
    }

    publicStringgetName(){
        returnname;
    }

    publicvoidsetName(Stringname){
        this.name=name;
    }

    publicPersongetOwner(){
        returnowner;
    }

    publicvoidsetOwner(Personowner){
        this.owner=owner;
    }}Most of the boilerplate in this example exists to provide encapsulation. If the variables name and owner were declared as public, the accessor and mutator methods would not be needed.
To reduce the amount of boilerplate, many frameworks have been developed, e.g. Lombok for Java.[4] The same code as above is auto-generated by Lombok using Java annotations, which is a form of metaprogramming:
@AllArgsConstructor@Getter@SetterpublicclassPet{
    privateStringname;
    privatePersonowner;}In some other programming languages it may be possible to achieve the same thing with less boilerplate, when the language has built-in support for such common constructs. For example, the equivalent of the above Java code can be expressed in Scala using just one line of code:
caseclassPet(varname:String,varowner:Person)Or in C# using Automatic Properties with compiler generated backing fields:
publicclassPet{
    publicstringName{get;set;}
    publicPersonOwner{get;set;}}Method boilerplate[edit]In addition to declarations, methods in OOP languages also contribute to the amount of boilerplate. A 2015 study on popular Java projects shows that 60% of methods can be uniquely identified by the occurrence of 4.6% of its tokens, making the remaining 95.4% boilerplate irrelevant to logic. The researchers believe this result would translate to subroutines in procedual languages in general.[5]HTML[edit]In HTML, the following boilerplate is used as a basic empty template and is present in most web pages:
<!DOCTYPE html><htmllang=""en""><head>
  <metacharset=""UTF-8""/>
  <title></title></head><body>

</body></html>The WHATWG HTML Living Standard defines that the <html>, <head> and <body> tags may be safely omitted under most circumstances.[6] The <meta charset=""UTF-8""> tag may also be omitted if the Web server is properly configured to send the character encoding along with the content type.[7]Google's HTML/CSS style guide recommends that all optional tags be omitted,[8] resulting in a much more compact boilerplate:

It can be used to develop web applications, server side apps, and also desktop applications with use of Electron. Its syntax is mostly comparable to that of Haskell. In addition, it introduces row polymorphism and extensible records.[2] Also, contrary to Haskell, PureScript adheres to a strict evaluation strategy.
Contents1History2Features3Examples4See also5References6External links

History[edit]PureScript was initially designed by Phil Freeman in 2013. He started to work on PureScript as various attempts to compile Haskell to JavaScript while preserving its semantics (e.g. using Fay, Haste, or GHCJS) didn't work to his satisfaction.[3] 
Since then it has been picked up by the community and is developed on GitHub. Additional core tools developed by the community include the dedicated build tool ""Pulp""[4], the documentation directory ""Pursuit""[5], and the package manager ""Spago""[6]Features[edit]PureScript features strict evaluation, persistent data structures and type inference. The PureScript type system shares many features with those of similar functional languages like Haskell: algebraic data types and pattern matching, higher kinded types, type classes and functional dependencies, and higher-rank polymorphism. PureScript's type system adds support for row polymorphism and extensible records.[7] However, PureScript lacks support for some of the more advanced features of Haskell like GADTs and type families.
The PureScript compiler attempts to produce readable JavaScript code, where possible. Through a simple FFI interface, it also allows the reuse of existing JavaScript code.[8]PureScript supports incremental compilation, and the compiler distribution includes support for building source code editor plugins for iterative development[9]. Editor plugins exist for many popular text editors, including Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, Atom and Visual Studio Code.
PureScript supports type-driven development via its typed holes feature[10], in which a program can be constructed with missing subexpressions. The compiler will subsequently attempt to infer the types of the missing subexpressions, and report those types to the user. This feature has inspired similar work in the GHCHaskell compiler.[11]Examples[edit]
Here is a minimal ""Hello world"" program in PureScript:1 moduleMainwhere2 3 importEffect.Console(log)4 5 main=log""Hello World!""
Here, the type of the program is inferred and checked by the PureScript compiler. A more verbose version of the same program might include explicit type annotations:1moduleMainwhere23importPrelude45importEffect(Effect)6importEffect.Console(log)78main::EffectUnit9main=log""Hello World!""See also[edit].mw-parser-output .portal{border:solid #aaa 1px;padding:0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tleft{margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tright{margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul{display:table;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0.1em;max-width:175px;background:#f9f9f9;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li{display:table-row}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:first-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:last-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle}Free and open-source software portalElm: A domain-specific programming language for declaratively creating web browser-based graphical user interfacesReason: A syntax extension and toolchain for OCaml that can also transpile to JavaScriptReferences[edit]^""purescript/purescript"".

Wikipedia does not publish original research. Its content is determined by previously published information rather than the beliefs or experiences of editors. Even if you are sure something is true, it must be verifiable before you can add it.[1] If reliable sources disagree, then maintain a neutral point of view and present what the various sources say, giving each side its due weight.
All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable. All quotations, and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. Any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. Please immediately remove contentious material about living people that is unsourced or poorly sourced.
For how to write citations, see citing sources. Verifiability, no original research, and neutral point of view are Wikipedia's core content policies. They work together to determine content, so editors should understand the key points of all three. Articles must also comply with the copyright policy.

All content must be verifiable. The burden to demonstrate verifiability lies with the editor who adds or restores material, and it is satisfied by providing an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[2] the contribution.[3]Attribute all quotations, and any material whose verifiability is challenged or likely to be challenged, to a reliable, published source using an inline citation. The cited source must clearly support the material as presented in the article. Cite the source clearly, ideally giving page number(s) – though sometimes a section, chapter, or other division may be appropriate instead; see Wikipedia:Citing sources for details of how to do this.
Any material lacking a reliable source directly supporting it may be removed and should not be restored without an inline citation to a reliable source. Whether and how quickly material should be initially removed for not having an inline citation to a reliable source depends on the material and the overall state of the article. In some cases, editors may object if you remove material without giving them time to provide references; consider adding a citation needed tag as an interim step.[4] When tagging or removing material for lacking an inline citation, please state your concern that it may not be possible to find a published reliable source and the material therefore may not be verifiable.[5] If you think the material is verifiable, you are encouraged to provide an inline citation yourself before considering whether to remove or tag it.
Do not leave unsourced or poorly sourced material in an article if it might damage the reputation of living people[6] or existing groups, and do not move it to the talk page. You should also be aware of how Wikipedia:Biographies of living personsapplies to groups.
 Reliable sourcesPolicy shortcutsWP:SOURCEWP:SOURCES""WP:SOURCE"" redirects here. For the <source> tag, see Wikipedia:Syntax highlighting. For how to reference sources, see Help:Referencing for beginners.What counts as a reliable sourceFurther information: Wikipedia:Reliable sourcesThe word ""source"" when citing sources on Wikipedia has three related meanings:
The piece of work itself (the article, book)The creator of the work (the writer, journalist)The publisher of the work (for example, Random House or Cambridge University Press)All three can affect reliability.
Base articles on reliable, independent, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Source material must have been published, the definition of which for our purposes is ""made available to the public in some form"".[7]Unpublished materials are not considered reliable. Use sources that directly support the material presented in an article and are appropriate to the claims made. The appropriateness of any source depends on the context. The best sources have a professional structure in place for checking or analyzing facts, legal issues, evidence, and arguments. The greater the degree of scrutiny given to these issues, the more reliable the source. Be especially careful when sourcing content related to living people or medicine.
If available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources in topics such as history, medicine, and science.
Editors may also use material from reliable non-academic sources, particularly if it appears in respected mainstream publications. Other reliable sources include:
University-level textbooksBooks published by respected publishing housesMagazinesMainstream newspapersEditors may also use electronic media, subject to the same criteria. See details in Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources and Wikipedia:Search engine test.
Newspaper and magazine blogsPolicy shortcutWP:NEWSBLOGSome newspapers, magazines, and other news organizations host online columns they call blogs. These may be acceptable sources if the writers are professionals, but use them with caution because blogs may not be subject to the news organization's normal fact-checking process.[8] If a news organization publishes an opinion piece in a blog, attribute the statement to the writer, e.g. ""Jane Smith wrote ..."" Never use as sources the blog comments that are left by readers. For personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources, see § Self-published sources below.
Reliable sources noticeboard and guidelineFurther information: Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard and Wikipedia:Reliable sourcesTo discuss the reliability of a specific source for a particular statement, consult Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard, which seeks to apply this policy to particular cases. For a guideline discussing the reliability of particular types of sources, see Wikipedia:Reliable sources. In the case of inconsistency between this policy and the Wikipedia:Reliable sources guideline, or any other guideline related to sourcing, this policy has priority.
Sources that are usually not reliable""WP:NOTRELIABLE"" redirects here. For Wikipedia's own reliability, see Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a reliable source.See also: Wikipedia:Reliable sources § Questionable and self-published sources, and Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sourcesPolicy shortcutsWP:NOTRELIABLEWP:NOTRSWP:QSQuestionable sourcesQuestionable sources are those that have a poor reputation for checking the facts, lack meaningful editorial oversight, or have an apparent conflict of interest.
Such sources include websites and publications expressing views that are widely considered by other sources to be extremist or promotional, or that rely heavily on unsubstantiated gossip, rumor or personal opinion. Questionable sources should be used only as sources for material on themselves, such as in articles about themselves; see below. They are not suitable sources for contentious claims about others.
Predatory open access journals are also questionable, due to lack of effective peer-review.
Self-published sourcesPolicy shortcutsWP:SPSWP:SELFPUBWP:SELFPUBLISHWP:BLOGSFurther information: Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons § Avoid self-published sources, Wikipedia:List of self-publishing companies, and Wikipedia:Identifying and using self-published worksAnyone can create a personal web page, self-publish a book, or claim to be an expert. That is why self-published material such as books, patents, newsletters, personal websites, open wikis, personal or group blogs (as distinguished from newsblogs, above), content farms, Internet forum postings, and social media postings are largely not acceptable as sources. Self-published expert sources may be considered reliable when produced by an established subject-matter expert, whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable, independent publications.[8] Exercise caution when using such sources: if the information in question is suitable for inclusion, someone else will probably have published it in independent reliable sources.[9]Never use self-published sources as third-party sources about living people, even if the author is an expert, well-known professional researcher, or writer.

the material is neither unduly self-serving nor an exceptional claim;it does not involve claims about third parties;it does not involve claims about events not directly related to the source;there is no reasonable doubt as to its authenticity; andthe article is not based primarily on such sources.This policy also applies to material published by the subject on social networking websites such as Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Facebook.

For links on a page that redirect back to the same page, see WP:SELFRED.See also: WP:COPYWITHIN, Wikipedia:List of citogenesis incidents, and Wikipedia:Citing WikipediaDo not use articles from Wikipedia (whether this English Wikipedia or Wikipedias in other languages) as sources. Also, do not use websites that mirror Wikipedia content or publications that rely on material from Wikipedia as sources. Content from a Wikipedia article is not considered reliable unless it is backed up by citing reliable sources. Confirm that these sources support the content, then use them directly.[10] (There is also a risk of circular reference/circular reporting when using a Wikipedia article or derivative work as a source.)
An exception is allowed when Wikipedia itself is being discussed in the article, which may cite an article, guideline, discussion, statistic, or other content from Wikipedia (or a sister project) to support a statement about Wikipedia. Wikipedia or the sister project is a primary source in this case, and may be used following the policy for primary sources. Any such use should avoid original research, undue emphasis on Wikipedia's role or views, and inappropriate self-reference. The article text should make it clear the material is sourced from Wikipedia so the reader is aware of the potential bias.
AccessibilityAccess to sourcesPolicy shortcutsWP:PAYWALLWP:SOURCEACCESSSee also: Wikipedia:Offline sources, Wikipedia:WikiProject Resource Exchange/Resource Request, and Wikipedia:Reliable sources/CostSome reliable sources may not be easily accessible. For example, an online source may require payment, and a print-only source may be available only through libraries. Rare historical sources may even be available only in special museum collections and archives. Do not reject reliable sources just because they are difficult or costly to access. If you have trouble accessing a source, others may be able to do so on your behalf (see WikiProject Resource Exchange).
Non-English sourcesPolicy shortcutsWP:RSUEWP:NOENGWP:NONENGSee also: Wikipedia:Translators available and Wikipedia:No original research § Translations and transcriptionsCitingCitations to non-English reliable sources are allowed on the English Wikipedia. However, because this project is in English, English-language sources are preferred over non-English ones when available and of equal quality and relevance. As with sources in English, if a dispute arises involving a citation to a non-English source, editors may request a quotation of relevant portions of the original source be provided, either in text, in a footnote, or on the article talk page.[11] (See Template:Request quotation.)
QuotingIf you quote a non-English reliable source (whether in the main text or in a footnote), a translation into English should always accompany the quote. Translations published by reliable sources are preferred over translations by Wikipedians, but translations by Wikipedians are preferred over machine translations. When using a machine translation of source material, editors should be reasonably certain the translation is accurate and the source is appropriate. Editors should not rely upon machine translations of non-English sources in contentious articles or biographies of living people. If needed, ask an editor who can translate it for you.
In articles, the original text is usually included with the translated text when translated by Wikipedians, and the translating editor is usually not cited. When quoting any material, whether in English or in some other language, be careful not to violate copyright; see the fair-use guideline.
Other issuesVerifiability does not guarantee inclusionShortcutsWP:VNOTWP:ONUS""WP:ONUS"" redirects here. For the responsibility to demonstrate verifiability, see WP:BURDEN.See also: WP:UNDUE, WP:PAGEDECIDE, WP:PRESERVE, WP:SUMMARY, and WP:IINFOWhile information must be verifiable to be included in an article, not all verifiable information needs to be included in an article. Consensus may determine that certain information does not improve an article, and that it should be omitted or presented instead in a different article. The onus to achieve consensus for inclusion is on those seeking to include disputed content.
Tagging a sentence, section, or articleFurther information: Wikipedia:Citation needed and Wikipedia:Template messages/Sources of articlesShortcutWP:FAILEDVERIFICATIONIf you want to request a source for an unsourced statement, you can tag a sentence with the {{citation needed}} template by writing {{cn}} or {{fact}}. There are other templates for tagging sections or entire articles here. You can also leave a note on the talk page asking for a source, or move the material to the talk page and ask for a source there. To request verification that a reference supports the text, tag it with {{verification needed}}. Material that fails verification may be tagged with {{failed verification}} or removed. When using templates to tag material, it is helpful to other editors if you explain your rationale in the template, edit summary, or on the talk page.
Take special care with contentious material about living and recently deceased people. Unsourced or poorly sourced material that is contentious, especially text that is negative, derogatory, or potentially damaging, should be removed immediately rather than tagged or moved to the talk page.
Exceptional claims require exceptional sourcesPolicy shortcutsWP:REDFLAGWP:EXCEPTIONALWP:EXTRAORDINARYSee also: Wikipedia:Fringe theoriesAny exceptional claim requires multiple high-quality sources.[12]Warnings (red flags) that should prompt extra caution include:
Surprising or apparently important claims not covered by multiple mainstream sources;Challenged claims that are supported purely by primary or self-published sources or those with an apparent conflict of interest;Reports of a statement by someone that seems out of character or against an interest they had previously defended;Claims that are contradicted by the prevailing view within the relevant community or that would significantly alter mainstream assumptions—especially in science, medicine, history, politics, and biographies of living and recently dead people. This is especially true when proponents say there is a conspiracy to silence them.Verifiability and other principlesCopyright and plagiarismFurther information: Wikipedia:Copyright, Wikipedia:Plagiarism, Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia, Wikipedia:MOS § Attribution, and Wikipedia:CITE § In-text attributionPolicy shortcutWP:YTCOPYRIGHTDo not plagiarize or breach copyright when using sources. Summarize source material in your own words as much as possible; when quoting or closely paraphrasing a source use an inline citation, and in-text attribution where appropriate.
Do not link to any source that violates the copyrights of others per contributors' rights and obligations. You can link to websites that display copyrighted works as long as the website has licensed the work, or uses the work in a way compliant with fair use. Knowingly directing others to material that violates copyright may be considered contributory copyright infringement. If there is reason to think a source violates copyright, do not cite it. This is particularly relevant when linking to sites such as Scribd or YouTube, where due care should be taken to avoid linking to material that violates copyright.NeutralityFurther information: Wikipedia:Neutral point of viewEven when information is cited to reliable sources, you must present it with a neutral point of view (NPOV). Articles should be based on thorough research of sources. All articles must adhere to NPOV, fairly representing all majority and significant-minority viewpoints published by reliable sources, in rough proportion to the prominence of each view. Tiny-minority views need not be included, except in articles devoted to them. If there is disagreement between sources, use in-text attribution: ""John Smith argues X, while Paul Jones maintains Y,"" followed by an inline citation. Sources themselves do not need to maintain a neutral point of view. Indeed, many reliable sources are not neutral. Our job as editors is simply to summarize what the reliable sources say.
NotabilityFurther information: Wikipedia:NotabilityIf no reliable, independent sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it (i.e., the topic is not notable).
Original researchFurther information: Wikipedia:No original researchThe no original research policy (NOR) is closely related to the Verifiability policy. Among its requirements are:
All material in Wikipedia articles must be attributable to a reliable published source. This means a reliable published source must exist for it, whether or not it is cited in the article.Sources must support the material clearly and directly: drawing inferences from multiple sources to advance a novel position is prohibited by the NOR policy.[11]Base articles largely on reliable secondary sources. While primary sources are appropriate in some cases, relying on them can be problematic. For more information, see the Primary, secondary, and tertiary sources section of the NOR policy, and the Misuse of primary sources section of the BLP policy.See alsoGuidelinesReliable sourcesIdentifying reliable sources (medicine)Information pages.mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}Wikipedia is not a reliable sourceCore content policiesHow to mine a sourceIdentifying and using independent sourcesIdentifying and using primary sourcesIdentifying and using self-published worksVideo linksWhen to citeResourcesImproving referencing effortsTemplate messages/Sources of articlesWikiProject ReliabilityThe Wikipedia LibraryWikiProject Resource ExchangeEssaysCitation clutterIdentifying and using tertiary sourcesVerifiability, not truthNotes^This principle was previously expressed on this policy page as ""the threshold for inclusion is verifiability, not truth"". See the essay, Wikipedia:Verifiability, not truth.^A source ""directly supports"" a given piece of material if the information is directly present in the source, so that using this source to support the material is not a violation of Wikipedia:No original research. The location of any citation—including whether one is present in the article at all—is unrelated to whether a source directly supports the material. For questions about where and how to place citations, see Wikipedia:Citing sources, Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section § Citations, etc.^Once an editor has provided any source he or she believes, in good faith, to be sufficient, then any editor who later removes the material has an obligation to articulate specific problems that would justify its exclusion from Wikipedia (e.g. why the source is unreliable; the source does not support the claim; undue emphasis; unencyclopedic content; etc.). If necessary, all editors are then expected to help achieve consensus, and any problems with the text or sourcing should be fixed before the material is added back.^It may be that the article contains so few citations it is impractical to add specific citation needed tags. Consider then tagging a section with {{unreferenced section}}, or the article with the applicable of either {{unreferenced}} or {{more citations needed}}. For a disputed category or on a disambiguation page, consider asking for a citation on the talk page.^When tagging or removing such material, please keep in mind such edits can easily be misunderstood. Some editors object to others' making chronic, frequent, and large-scale deletions of unsourced information, especially if unaccompanied by other efforts to improve the material. Do not concentrate only on material of a particular point of view, as that may appear to be a contravention of Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Also check to see whether the material is sourced to a citation elsewhere on the page. For all these reasons, it is advisable to communicate clearly that you have a considered reason to believe the material in question cannot be verified.^Wales, Jimmy. ""Zero information is preferred to misleading or false information"", WikiEN-l, May 16, 2006: ""I can NOT emphasize this enough. There seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative 'I heard it somewhere' pseudo information is to be tagged with a 'needs a cite' tag. Wrong. It should be removed, aggressively, unless it can be sourced. This is true of all information, but it is particularly true of negative information about living persons.""^This includes material such as documents in publicly accessible archives as well as inscriptions in plain sight, e.g. tombstones.^ abPlease do note that any exceptional claim would require exceptional sources.^Self-published material is characterized by the lack of independent reviewers (those without a conflict of interest) validating the reliability of content. Further examples of self-published sources include press releases, material contained within company websites, advertising campaigns, material published in media by the owner(s)/publisher(s) of the media group, self-released music albums and electoral manifestos:
The University of California, Berkeley library states: ""Most pages found in general search engines for the web are self-published or published by businesses small and large with motives to get you to buy something or believe a point of view. Even within university and library web sites, there can be many pages that the institution does not try to oversee.""Princeton University offers this understanding in its publication, Academic Integrity at Princeton (2011): ""Unlike most books and journal articles, which undergo strict editorial review before publication, much of the information on the Web is self-published. To be sure, there are many websites in which you can have confidence: mainstream newspapers, refereed electronic journals, and university, library, and government collections of data. But for vast amounts of Web-based information, no impartial reviewers have evaluated the accuracy or fairness of such material before it's made instantly available across the globe.""The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th Edition states, ""any Internet site that does not have a specific publisher or sponsoring body should be treated as unpublished or self-published work.""^Rekdal, Ole Bjørn (1 August 2014).

Do not violate the source's copyright when doing so.^Hume, David. An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, Forgotten Books, 1984, pp. 82, 86; first published in 1748 as Philosophical enquiries concerning human Understanding, (or the Oxford 1894 edition OL 7067396M at para. 91) ""A wise man ... proportions his belief to the evidence ... That no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavours to establish; and even in that case there is a mutual destruction of arguments, and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force, which remains, after deducting the inferior."" In the 18th century, Pierre-Simon Laplace reformulated the idea as ""The weight of evidence for an extraordinary claim must be proportioned to its strangeness."" Marcello Truzzi recast it again, in 1978, as ""An extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof."" Carl Sagan, finally, popularized the concept broadly as ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" in 1980 on Cosmos: A Personal Voyage; this was the formulation originally used on Wikipedia.Further readingWales, Jimmy.

Deleted[edit]This template has been deleted per Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_May_25#Template:Major_programming_languages. I have left the talk page in place if people want to discuss alternatives to this template. —Ruud 20:29, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
I was one who originally wanted to delete this template because of its inherit POV issues, but ultimately I agreed with other editors on a compromise of using this template as a navigation aid.  I do agree that the template had gotten out of hand as fans of non-major languages kept inserting their favorite languages.  I would have voted to keep and fix the inclusion criteria (as I had lobbied to do at another time, but was shot down).  At any rate, I am sad that as a significant editor of this template, I was not notified that the template was up for deletion.  Wikipedia needs to be changed to make it a requirement that all past editors are notified when something is brought up for deletion consideration. —  Stevie is the man! Talk | Work 19:15, 12 June 2006 (UTC)You didn't follow the deletion discussion? matt kane's brain 21:30, 12 June 2006 (UTC)I didn't know it was up for deletion.  I don't watch all articles I've ever edited.  I like to maintain my sanity. :) —  Stevie is the man! Talk | Work 22:10, 12 June 2006 (UTC)khkuuhkuOh, I thought that you meant you were the one who nominated it for deletion. Is it forbidden to bring it back now? matt kane's brain 12:55, 13 June 2006 (UTC)If something has been deleted, it is generally not a good idea to try to resurrect it, unless perhaps all the problems discussed in the deletion process are resolved. —  Stevie is the man! Talk | Work 17:38, 13 June 2006 (UTC)One idea that came to me is that perhaps we should have a template that linked to families of programming language, with the actual languages linked on those articles. It is usually easier to get people to agree on a classification of a language than it is to get them to agree on its notability, and things can always be in two lists if necessary. GreenReaper 18:34, 13 June 2006 (UTC)I'm the template creator. I was not aware that the template was up for deletion, although I had been watching it, but I rather expected it to get deleted eventually - although I believe it was a useful navigation aid, it was too subjective. As for linking to proglang families, adding more clicks to reach common articles of interest compromises its role as a navigation aid. Maybe it would be better to define a similar template using a purely objective criterion such as statistics research listing the number of programmers who know/use a language. Whatever.

Bash is a single shell implementation.
It's not even used on many unixlikes: BSDs, etc.

Style and formatWikipedia is not a paper encyclopediaPolicy shortcutsWP:NOTPAPERWP:PAPERWikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, but a digital encyclopedia project. Other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page, there is no practical limit to the number of topics Wikipedia can cover or the total amount of content. However, there is an important distinction between what can be done, and what should be done, which is covered under § Encyclopedic content below. Consequently, this policy is not a free pass for inclusion: articles must abide by the appropriate content policies, particularly those covered in the five pillars.
Keeping articles to a reasonable size is important for Wikipedia's accessibility, especially for dial-up and mobile browser readers, since it directly affects page download time (see Wikipedia:Article size). Splitting long articles and leaving adequate summaries is a natural part of growth for a topic (see Wikipedia:Summary style). Some topics are covered by print encyclopedias only in short, static articles, but Wikipedia can include more information, provide more external links, and update more quickly.
Encyclopedic contentPolicy shortcutWP:NOTEVERYTHINGInformation should not be included in this encyclopedia solely because it is true or useful. A Wikipedia article should not be a complete exposition of all possible details, but a summary of accepted knowledge regarding its subject.[1] Verifiable and sourced statements should be treated with appropriate weight. Although there are debates about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries, consensus is that the following are good examples of what Wikipedia is not. The examples under each section are not intended to be exhaustive.
Wikipedia is not a dictionaryPolicy shortcutsWP:NOT#DICDEFWP:NOT#DICTWP:NOT#DICTIONARYMain page: Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionaryWikipedia is not a dictionary, or a usage or jargon guide. Wikipedia articles are not:
Definitions. Articles should begin with a good definition or description, but articles that contain nothing more than a definition should be expanded with additional encyclopedic content. If they cannot be expanded beyond a definition, Wikipedia is not the place for them. In some cases, the definition of a word may be an encyclopedic subject, such as the definition of planet. For a wiki that is a dictionary, visit our sister project Wiktionary. Dictionary definitions should be transwikied there.Dictionary entries. Encyclopedia articles are about a person, or a group, a concept, a place, a thing, an event, etc. In some cases, a word or phrase itself may be an encyclopedic subject, such as Macedonia (terminology) or truthiness. However, articles rarely, if ever, contain more than one distinct definition or usage of the article's title. Articles about the cultural or mathematical significance of individual numbers are also acceptable.Usage, slang, or idiom guides. Descriptive articles about languages, dialects, or types of slang (such as Klingon language, Cockney, or Leet) are desirable. Prescriptive guides for prospective speakers of such languages are not. See ""Wikipedia is not a manual, guidebook, textbook, or scientific journal"" below for more information. For a wiki that is a collection of textbooks, visit our sister project Wikibooks. Prescriptive guides for prospective speakers of a language should be transwikied there.Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thoughtPolicy shortcutsWP:FORUMWP:NOTFORUMWP:NOTESSAY""WP:FORUM"" redirects here. You may be looking for Wikipedia:Forum shopping or Wikipedia:Village pump.Wikipedia is not a place to publish your own thoughts and analyses or to publish new information. Per our policy on original research, please do not use Wikipedia for any of the following:
Primary (original) research, such as proposing theories and solutions, original ideas, defining terms, coining new words, etc. If you have completed primary research on a topic, your results should be published in other venues, such as peer-reviewed journals, other printed forms, open research, or respected online publications. Wikipedia can report your work after it is published and becomes part of accepted knowledge; however, citations of reliable sources are needed to demonstrate that material is verifiable, and not merely the editor's opinion.Personal inventions. If you or a friend invented a drinking game, a new type of dance move, or even the word frindle, it is not notable enough to be given an article until multiple, independent, and reliable secondary sources report on it. And Wikipedia is certainly not for things made up one day.Personal essays that state your particular feelings about a topic (rather than the opinions of experts). Although Wikipedia is supposed to compile human knowledge, it is not a vehicle to make personal opinions become part of such knowledge. In the unusual situation where the opinions of an individual are important enough to discuss, it is preferable to let other people write about them. (Personal essays on Wikipedia-related topics are welcome in your user namespace or on the Meta-wiki.)Discussion forums. Please try to stay on the task of creating an encyclopedia. You can chat with people about Wikipedia-related topics on their user talk pages, and should resolve problems with articles on the relevant talk pages, but please do not take discussion into articles. In addition, bear in mind that article talk pages exist solely to discuss how to improve articles; they are not for general discussion about the subject of the article, nor are they a help desk for obtaining instructions or technical assistance. Material unsuitable for talk pages may be subject to removal per the talk page guidelines. If you wish to ask a specific question on a topic, Wikipedia has a Reference desk; questions should be asked there rather than on talk pages.Wikipedia is not a soapbox or means of promotionPolicy shortcutsWP:NOTADVOCACYWP:NOTGOSSIPWP:NOTOPINIONWP:NOTSCANDALWP:PROMOWP:SOAPBOX""WP:PROMOTION"" redirects here. For other pages about advertising and promotion, see Wikipedia:Advertising.""WP:SOAP"" redirects here. For the Soap Operas WikiProject, see Wikipedia:WikiProject Soap Operas. 
Wikipedia is not a soapbox, a battleground, or a vehicle for propaganda, advertising and showcasing. This applies to usernames, articles, drafts, categories, files, talk page discussions, templates, and user pages. Therefore, content hosted in Wikipedia is not for:
Advocacy, propaganda, or recruitment of any kind: commercial, political, scientific, religious, national, sports-related, or otherwise. An article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view. You might wish to start a blog or visit a forum if you want to convince people of the merits of your opinions.[2]Opinion pieces. Although some topics, particularly those concerning current affairs and politics, may stir passions and tempt people to ""climb soapboxes"", Wikipedia is not the medium for this. Articles must be balanced to put entries, especially for current events, in a reasonable perspective, and represent a neutral point of view. Furthermore, Wikipedia authors should strive to write articles that will not quickly become obsolete. However, Wikipedia's sister project Wikinews allows commentaries on its articles.Scandal mongering, promoting things ""heard through the grapevine"" or gossiping. Articles and content about living people are required to meet an especially high standard, as they may otherwise be libellous or infringe the subjects' right to privacy. Articles must not be written purely to attack the reputation of another person.Self-promotion. It can be tempting to write about yourself or projects in which you have a strong personal involvement. However, remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other. This includes the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view, which can be difficult when writing about yourself or about projects close to you. Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical sources, such as your résumé or curriculum vitae, is unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography, Wikipedia:Notability and Wikipedia:Conflict of interest.Advertising, marketing or public relations. Information about companies and products must be written in an objective and unbiased style, free of puffery. All article topics must be verifiable with independent, third-party sources, so articles about very small garage bands or local companies are typically unacceptable. Wikipedia articles about a person, company or organization are not an extension of their website or other social media marketing efforts. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they identify notable organizations which are the topic of the article. Wikipedia neither endorses organizations nor runs affiliate programs. See also Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies) for guidelines on corporate notability. Those promoting causes or events, or issuing public service announcements, even if noncommercial, should use a forum other than Wikipedia to do so. Contributors must disclose any payments they receive for editing Wikipedia. See also Wikipedia:Conflict of interest.Non-disruptive statements of opinion on internal Wikipedia policies and guidelines may be made on user pages and within the Wikipedia: namespace, as they are relevant to the current and future operation of the project. However, article talk pages should not be used by editors as platforms for their personal views on a subject (see Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines).
Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media filesPolicy shortcutsWP:LINKFARMWP:NOTMIRRORWP:NOTREPOSITORYWP:NOTGALLERYWikipedia is neither a mirror nor a repository of links, images, or media files.[3] Wikipedia articles are not merely collections of:
External links or Internet directories. There is nothing wrong with adding one or more useful content-relevant links to the external links section of an article; however, excessive lists can dwarf articles and detract from the purpose of Wikipedia. On articles about topics with many fansites, for example, including a link to one major fansite may be appropriate. See Wikipedia:External links for some guidelines.Internal links, except for disambiguation pages when an article title is ambiguous, and for lists for browsing or to assist with article organization and navigation; for these, please follow relevant guidance at Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists, Wikipedia:Stand-alone lists and Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Embedded lists.Public domain or other source material such as entire books or source code, original historical documents, letters, laws, proclamations, and other source material that are useful only when presented with their original, unmodified wording. Complete copies of primary sources may go into Wikisource, but not on Wikipedia. Public domain resources such as the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica may be used to add content to an article (see Plagiarism guideline: Public-domain sources for guidelines on doing so). See also Wikipedia:Do not include the full text of lengthy primary sources and Wikisource's inclusion policy.Photographs or media files with no accompanying text. If you are interested in presenting a picture, please provide an encyclopedic context, or consider adding it to Wikimedia Commons. If a picture comes from a public domain source on a website, then consider adding it to Wikipedia:Images with missing articles or Wikipedia:Public domain image resources.Wikipedia is not a blog, web hosting service, social networking service, or memorial sitePolicy shortcutsWP:NOTWEBHOSTWP:NOTSOCIALNETWORKWP:NOTCVWP:NOTMEMORIAL""WP:MEMORIAL"" and ""WP:HOST"" redirect here.

Wikipedia is not a social networking service like Facebook or Twitter. You may not host your own website, blog, wiki, résumé, or cloud on Wikipedia. Wikipedia pages, including those in user space, are not:
Personal web pages.Wikipedians have individual user pages, but they should be used primarily to present information relevant to work on the encyclopedia. Limited autobiographical information is allowed, but user pages do not serve as personal webpages, blogs, or repositories for large amounts of material irrelevant to collaborating on Wikipedia. If you want to post your résumé or make a personal webpage, please use one of the many free providers on the Internet or any hosting included with your Internet service provider. The focus of user pages should not be social networking or amusement, but rather providing a foundation for effective collaboration. Humorous pages that refer to Wikipedia in some way may be created in an appropriate namespace. Personal web pages are often speedily deleted. Wikipedia articles use formal English and are not written in Internet posting style.File storage areas. Please upload only files that are used (or will be used) in encyclopedia articles or project pages; anything else will be deleted. If you have extra relevant images, consider uploading them to the Wikimedia Commons, where they can be linked from Wikipedia.Dating services. Wikipedia is not an appropriate place to pursue relationships or sexual encounters. User pages that move beyond broad expressions of sexual orientation are unacceptable. However, you very well may form new friendships as you go about improving the encyclopedia.Memorials. Subjects of encyclopedia articles must satisfy Wikipedia's notability requirements. Wikipedia is not the place to memorialize deceased friends, relatives, acquaintances, or others who do not meet such requirements. (WP:RIP is excluded from this rule.)Content for projects unrelated to Wikipedia. Do not store material unrelated to Wikipedia, including in userspace. Please see WP:UPNOT for examples of what may not be included.If you are interested in using the wiki technology for a collaborative effort on something else, even just a single page, many free and commercial sites provide wiki hosting. You can also install wiki software on your server. See the installation guide at MediaWiki.org for information on doing this. See also Wikipedia:Alternative outlets.
Your user page is not yours. It is a part of Wikipedia, and exists to make collaboration among Wikipedians easier, not for self promotion. 
Wikipedia is not a directoryPolicy shortcutsWP:NOTCATALOGWP:NOTDIRWP:NOTGENEALOGYWP:NOTTVGUIDE  Nuh-uh""WP:DIRECTORY"" redirects here. For a listing of Wikipedia's directories and indexes, see Wikipedia:Directory.See also: Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists, Wikipedia:Stand-alone lists, and Wikipedia:Embedded listsWikipedia encompasses many lists of links to articles within Wikipedia that are used for internal organization or to describe a notable subject. In that sense, Wikipedia functions as an index or directory of its own content. However, Wikipedia is not a directory of everything in the universe that exists or has existed. Please see Wikipedia:Alternative outlets for alternatives. Wikipedia articles are not:
Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as (but not limited to) quotations, aphorisms, or persons (real or fictional). If you want to enter lists of quotations, put them into our sister project Wikiquote. Of course, there is nothing wrong with having lists if their entries are relevant because they are associated with or significantly contribute to the list topic. Wikipedia also includes reference tables and tabular information for quick reference. Merged groups of small articles based on a core topic are permitted. (See Wikipedia:Stand-alone lists § Appropriate topics for lists for clarification.)Genealogical entries. Family histories should be presented only where appropriate to support the reader's understanding of a notable topic.The white or yellow pages. Contact information such as phone numbers, fax numbers and e-mail addresses is not encyclopedic. Likewise, disambiguation pages (such as John Smith) are not intended to be complete listings of every person named John Smith—just the notable ones.Directories, directory entries, electronic program guides, or resources for conducting business. For example, an article on a broadcaster should not list upcoming events, current promotions, current schedules, format clocks, etc., although mention of major events, promotions or historically significant program lists and schedules may be acceptable. Likewise an article on a business should not contain a list of all the company's patent filings. Furthermore, the Talk pages associated with an article are for talking about the article, not for conducting the business of the topic of the article.Sales catalogues. An article should not include product pricing or availability information unless there is an independent sourceand a justified reason for the mention. Encyclopedic significance may be indicated if mainstream media sources (not just product reviews) provide commentary on these details instead of just passing mention. Prices and product availability can vary widely from place to place and over time. Wikipedia is not a price comparison service to compare the prices of competing products, or the prices and availability of a single product from different vendors or retailers.Non-encyclopedic cross-categorizations, such as ""people from ethnic / cultural / religious group X employed by organization Y"" or ""restaurants specializing in food type X in city Y"". Cross-categories such as these are not considered a sufficient basis for creating an article, unless the intersection of those categories is in some way a culturally significant phenomenon. See also Wikipedia:Overcategorization for this issue in categories.Simple listings without context information. Examples include, but are not limited to: listings of business alliances, clients, competitors, employees (except CEOs, supervisory directors and similar top functionaries), equipment, estates, offices, store locations, products and services, sponsors, subdivisions and tourist attractions. Information about relevant single entries with encyclopedic information should be added as sourced prose. Lists of creative works in a wider context are permitted.Wikipedia is not a manual, guidebook, textbook, or scientific journalPolicy shortcutsWP:NOTGUIDEWP:NOTHOWTOWP:NOTTEXTBOOKWP:NOTTRAVEL  It's a cookbook!(But Wikipedia is not.)Wikipedia is an encyclopedic reference, not an instruction manual, guidebook, or textbook. Wikipedia articles should not read like:
Instruction manuals. While Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places and things, an article should not read like a ""how-to"" style owner's manual, cookbook, advice column (legal, medical or otherwise) or suggestion box. This includes tutorials, instruction manuals, game guides, and recipes. Describing to the reader how people or things use or do something is encyclopedic; instructing the reader in the imperative mood about how to use or do something is not.[4] Such guides may be welcome at Wikibooks instead.Travel guides. An article on Paris should mention landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, but not the telephone number or street address of the ""best"" restaurants, nor the current price of a café au lait on the Champs-Élysées. Wikipedia is not the place to recreate content more suited to entries in hotel or culinary guides, travelogues, and the like. Notable locations may meet the inclusion criteria, but the resulting articles need not include every tourist attraction, restaurant, hotel or venue, etc. While travel guides for a city will often mention distant attractions, a Wikipedia article for a city should list only those that are actually in the city. If you do wish to help write a travel guide, your contributions would be more than welcome at our sister project, Wikivoyage.Game guides. An article about a game should briefly summarize the story and the main actions the player performs in the game. Avoid lists of gameplay concepts and items unless these are notable as discussed in secondary sources in their own right in gaming context (such as the BFG9000 from the Doom series). A concise summary of gameplay details (specific point values, achievements, time-limits, levels, types of enemies, etc.) is appropriate if it is essential to understanding the game or its significance in the industry, but walk-throughs and detailed coverage are not. See also WP:WAF and WP:VGSCOPE.Internet guides. Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers, but should also describe the site in an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance, which can be kept significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources, since editors can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known. See the Current events portal for examples.FAQs. Wikipedia articles should not list frequently asked questions (FAQs). Instead, format the information as neutral prose within the appropriate article(s).Textbooks and annotated texts. Wikipedia is an encyclopedic reference, not a textbook. The purpose of Wikipedia is to present facts, not to teach subject matter. Articles should not read like textbooks, with leading questions and systematic problem solutions as examples. These belong on our sister projects, such as Wikibooks, Wikisource, and Wikiversity. Some kinds of examples, specifically those intended to inform rather than to instruct, may be appropriate for inclusion in a Wikipedia article.Scientific journals. A Wikipedia article should not be presented on the assumption that the reader is well-versed in the topic's field. Introductory language in the lead (and sometimes the initial sections) of the article should be written in plain terms and concepts that can be understood by any literate reader of Wikipedia without any knowledge in the given field before advancing to more detailed explanations of the topic. While wikilinks should be provided for advanced terms and concepts in that field, articles should be written on the assumption that the reader will not or cannot follow these links, instead attempting to infer their meaning from the text. See Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking.Academic language. Texts should be written for everyday readers, not just for academics. Article titles should reflect common usage, not academic terminology, whenever possible. Academic language in the text should be explained in lay terms.Case studies. Many topics are based on the relationship of factor X to factor Y, resulting in one or more full articles. For example, this could refer to situation X in location Y, or version X of item Y. This is perfectly acceptable when the two variables put together represent some culturally significant phenomenon or some otherwise notable interest. Often, separate articles are needed for a subject within a range of different countries, due to substantial differences across international borders; articles such as ""Slate industry in Wales"" and ""Island fox"" are fitting examples. Writing about ""Oak trees in North Carolina"" or ""Blue trucks"", however, would likely constitute a POV fork or original research, and would certainly not result in an encyclopedic article.Wikipedia is not a crystal ballPolicy shortcutsWP:CRYSTALWP:CRYSTALBALL  ... but Wikipedia does not.Wikipedia is not a collection of unverifiable speculation or presumptions. Wikipedia does not predict the future. All articles about anticipated events must be verifiable, and the subject matter must be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article if the event had already occurred. It is appropriate to report discussion and arguments about the prospects for success of future proposals and projects or whether some development will occur, if discussion is properly referenced. It is not appropriate for editors to insert their own opinions or analyses. Predictions, speculation, forecasts and theories stated by reliable, expert sources or recognized entities in a field may be included, though editors should be aware of creating undue bias to any specific point-of-view. In forward-looking articles about unreleased products, such as films and games, take special care to avoid advertising and unverified claims (for films, see WP:NFF). In particular:
Individual scheduled or expected future events should be included only if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. Dates are not definite until the event actually takes place, as even otherwise-notable events can be cancelled or postponed at the last minute by a major incident. If preparation for the event is not already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented. Examples of appropriate topics include the 2024 U.S. presidential election and 2028 Summer Olympics. By comparison, the 2036 U.S. presidential election and 2044 Summer Olympics are not appropriate article topics if nothing can be said about them that is verifiable and not original research. Avoid predicted sports team line-ups, which are inherently unverifiable and speculative. A schedule of future events may be appropriate if it can be verified. As an exception, even highly speculative articles about events that may or may not occur far in the future might be appropriate, where coverage in reliable sources is sufficient. For example, Ultimate fate of the universe is an acceptable topic.Individual items from a predetermined list or a systematic pattern of names, pre-assigned to future events or discoveries, are not suitable article topics, if only generic information is known about the item. Lists of tropical cyclone names is encyclopedic; ""Tropical Storm Alex (2022)"" is not, even though it is virtually certain that such a storm will occur. Similarly, articles about words formed on a predictable numeric system (such as ""septenquinquagintillion"") are not encyclopedic unless they are defined on good authority, or genuinely in use. Certain scientific extrapolations are considered to be encyclopedic, such as chemical elements documented by IUPAC before isolation in the laboratory, provided that scientists have made significant non-trivial predictions of their properties.Articles that present original research in the form of extrapolation, speculation, and ""future history"" are inappropriate. Although scientific and cultural norms continually evolve, we must wait for this evolution to happen, rather than try to predict it. Of course, we do and should have articles aboutnotableartistic works, essays, or credible research that embody predictions. An article on weapons in Star Trek is appropriate; an article on ""Weapons to be used in World War III"" is not.Although currently accepted scientific paradigms may later be rejected, and hypotheses previously held to be controversial or incorrect sometimes become accepted by the scientific community, it is not the place of Wikipedia to venture such projections.Wikipedia is not a collection of product announcements and rumors. Although Wikipedia includes up-to-date knowledge about newly revealed products, short articles that consist of only product announcement information are not appropriate. Until such time that more encyclopedic knowledge about the product can be verified, product announcements should be merged to a larger topic (such as an article about the creator(s), a series of products, or a previous product) if applicable.Wikipedia is not a newspaperPolicy shortcutsWP:NOTNEWSWP:NOTWHOSWHOWP:NOTDIARYSee also: Wikipedia:Notability (events) and Wikipedia:Too much detailEditors are encouraged to include current and up-to-date information within its coverage, and to develop stand-alone articles on significant current events. However, not all verifiable events are suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia. Ensure that Wikipedia articles are not:
Original reporting. Wikipedia should not offer first-hand news reports on breaking stories. Wikipedia does not constitute a primary source. However, our sister projects Wikisource and Wikinews do exactly that, and are intended to be primary sources. Wikipedia does have many encyclopedia articles on topics of historical significance that are currently in the news, and can be updated with recently verified information.News reports. Wikipedia considers the enduring notability of persons and events. While news coverage can be useful source material for encyclopedic topics, most newsworthy events do not qualify for inclusion and Wikipedia is not written in news style. For example, routine news reporting of announcements, sports, or celebrities is not a sufficient basis for inclusion in the encyclopedia. While including information on recent developments is sometimes appropriate, breaking news should not be emphasized or otherwise treated differently from other information. Timely news subjects not suitable for Wikipedia may be suitable for our sister project Wikinews, though that is not a particularly active project.Who's who. Even when an event is notable, individuals involved in it may not be. Unless news coverage of an individual goes beyond the context of a single event, our coverage of that individual should be limited to the article about that event, in proportion to their importance to the overall topic. (See Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons for more details.)A diary. Even when an individual is notable, not all events they are involved in are. For example, news reporting about celebrities and sports figures can be very frequent and cover a lot of trivia, but using all these sources would lead to over-detailed articles that look like a diary. Not every match played or goal scored is significant enough to be included in the biography of a person.Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of informationPolicy shortcutsWP:INDISCRIMINATEWP:PLOT""WP:PLOT"" redirects here. For information regarding plot summary manuals of style, see MOS:PLOT.See also: Wikipedia:Notability and Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Trivia sectionsTo provide encyclopedic value, data should be put in context with explanations referenced to independent sources. As explained in § Encyclopedic content above, merely being true, or even verifiable, does not automatically make something suitable for inclusion in the encyclopedia. Wikipedia articles should not be:
Summary-only descriptions of works. Wikipedia treats creative works (including, for example, works of art or fiction, video games, documentaries, research books or papers, and religious texts) in an encyclopedic manner, discussing the development, design, reception, significance, and influence of works in addition to concise summaries of those works. For more information regarding summaries, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Writing about fiction § Contextual presentation.Lyrics databases. An article about a song should provide information about authorship, date of publication, social impact, and so on. Quotations from a song should be kept to a reasonable length relative to the rest of the article, and used to facilitate discussion, or to illustrate the style; the full text can be put on Wikisource and linked to from the article. Most song lyrics published after 1924 are protected by copyright; any quotation of them must be kept to a minimum, and used for direct commentary or to illustrate some aspect of style. Never link to the lyrics of copyrighted songs unless the linked-to site clearly has the right to distribute the work. See Wikipedia:Do not include the full text of lengthy primary sources for full discussion.Excessive listings of unexplained statistics. Statistics that lack context or explanation can reduce readability and may be confusing; accordingly, statistics should be placed in tables to enhance readability, and articles with statistics should include explanatory text providing context. Where statistics are so lengthy as to impede the readability of the article, the statistics can be split into a separate article and summarized in the main article. (e.g., statistics from the main article 2012 United States presidential election have been moved to a related article Nationwide opinion polling for the 2012 United States presidential election). Wikipedia:Notability#Stand-alone lists offers more guidance on what kind of lists are acceptable, and Wikipedia:Stand-alone lists#Selection criteria offers guidance on what entries should be included.Exhaustive logs of software updates. Use reliable third-party (not self-published or official) sources in articles dealing with software updates to describe the versions listed or discussed in the article. Common sense must be applied with regard to the level of detail to be included.Wikipedia is not censoredPolicy shortcutsWP:CENSORWP:NOTCENSORED

“
The University is not engaged in making ideas safe for students. It is engaged in making students safe for ideas. Thus it permits the freest expression of views before students, trusting to their good sense in passing judgment on these views.
”
— University of California President Clark Kerr (1961)Main page: Wikipedia:Content disclaimerSee also: Censorship of WikipediaWikipedia may contain content that some readers consider objectionable or offensive‍—‌even exceedingly so. Attempting to ensure that articles and images will be acceptable to all readers, or will adhere to general social or religious norms, is incompatible with the purposes of an encyclopedia.
Content will be removed if it is judged to violate Wikipedia policies (especially those on biographies of living persons and neutral point of view) or the laws of the United States (where Wikipedia is hosted). However, because most edits are displayed immediately, inappropriate material may be visible to readers, for a time, before being detected and removed.
Some articles may include images, text, or links which are relevant to the topic but that some people find objectionable. Discussion of potentially objectionable content should usually focus not on its potential offensiveness but on whether it is an appropriate image, text, or link. Beyond that, ""being objectionable"" is generally not sufficient grounds for the removal of content. The Wikipedia:Offensive material guideline can help assess appropriate actions to take in the case of content that may be considered offensive.
Some organizations' rules or traditions call for secrecy with regard to certain information about them. Such restrictions do not apply to Wikipedia, because Wikipedia is not a member of those organizations; thus Wikipedia will not remove such information from articles if it is otherwise encyclopedic.
Community
The above policies are about Wikipedia's content. The following relate to Wikipedia's governance and processes.
Wikipedia is not an anarchy or forum for free speech  WP is En­cy­clo­pe­dists' Corner, not Speakers' Corner.Policy shortcutsWP:NOTANARCHYWP:NOTFREESPEECH""WP:ANARCHY"" redirects here. For WikiProject Anarchism, see Wikipedia:WikiProject Philosophy/Anarchism.See also: m:Power structure, WP:User access levels, and WP:EnforcementMain page: Wikipedia:AdministrationWikipedia is free and open, but restricts both freedom and openness where they interfere with creating an encyclopedia. Accordingly, Wikipedia is not a forum for unregulated free speech. The fact that Wikipedia is an open, self-governing project does not mean that any part of its purpose is to explore the viability of anarchist communities. Our purpose is to build an encyclopedia, not to test the limits of anarchism.
Wikipedia is not a democracyPolicy shortcutsWP:DEMWP:NOTDEMWP:DEMOCRACYWP:NOTDEMOCRACYSee also: Wikipedia:Polling is not a substitute for discussion and Wikipedia:Elections""WP:DEMOCRACY"" redirects here. For Wikipedia's democratic structures, see WP:WikiProject Democracy.Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy or any other political system. Its primary (though not exclusive) means of decision making and conflict resolution is editing and discussion leading to consensus—notvoting. (Voting is used for certain matters such as electing the Arbitration Committee.) Straw polls are sometimes used to test for consensus, but polls or surveys can impede, rather than foster, discussion and should be used with caution.
Wikipedia is not a bureaucracyPolicy shortcutsWP:BUROWP:NOTBUROSee also: Wikipedia:Ignore all rules""WP:BURO"" and ""WP:BUREAU"" redirect here. For the ""bureaucrat"" user access level, see WP:CRAT.While Wikipedia has many elements of a bureaucracy,[5] it is not governed by statute: it is not a quasi-judicial body, and rules are not the purpose of the community. Although some rules may be enforced, the written rules themselves do not set accepted practice. Rather, they document already existing community consensus regarding what should be accepted and what should be rejected.
While Wikipedia's written policies and guidelines should be taken seriously, they can be misused. Do not follow an overly strict interpretation of the letter of policies without consideration for their principles. If the rules truly prevent you from improving the encyclopedia, ignore them. Disagreements are resolved through consensus-based discussion, not by tightly sticking to rules and procedures. Furthermore, policies and guidelines themselves may be changed to reflect evolving consensus.
A procedural error made in a proposal or request is not grounds for rejecting that proposal or request.
A procedural, coding, or grammatical error in a new contribution is not grounds for reverting it, unless the error cannot easily be fixed.
Wikipedia is not a laboratoryPolicy shortcutWP:NOTLABResearch about Wikipedia's content, processes, and the people involved[6] can provide valuable insights and understanding that benefit public knowledge, scholarship, and the Wikipedia community, but Wikipedia is not a public laboratory. Research that analyzes articles, talk pages, or other content on Wikipedia is not typically controversial, since all of Wikipedia is open and freely usable. However, research projects that are disruptive to the community or which negatively affect articles—even temporarily—are not allowed and can result in loss of editing privileges. Before starting a potentially controversial project,[7] researchers should open discussion at the Village Pump to ensure it will not interfere with Wikipedia's mission. Regardless of the type of project, researchers are advised to be as transparent as possible on their user pages, disclosing information such as institutional connections and intentions.[8]Some editors explicitly request to not be subjects in research and experiments. Please respect the wish of editors to opt-out of research.
Wikipedia is not a battlegroundPolicy shortcutsWP:BATTLEGROUNDWP:BATTLESee also: Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not about winning and Wikipedia:Edit warringWikipedia is not a place to hold grudges, import personal conflicts, carry on ideological battles, or nurture prejudice, hatred, or fear. Making personal battles out of Wikipedia discussions goes directly against our policies and goals. In addition to avoiding battles in discussions, do not try to advance your position in disagreements by making unilateral changes to policies. Do not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point.
Every user is expected to interact with others civilly, calmly, and in a spirit of cooperation. Do not insult, harass, or intimidate those with whom you have a disagreement. Rather, approach the matter intelligently and engage in polite discussion. If another user behaves in an uncivil, uncooperative, or insulting manner, or even tries to harass or intimidate you, this does not give you an excuse to respond in kind. Address only the factual points brought forward, ignoring the inappropriate comments, or disregard that user entirely. If necessary, point out gently that you think the comments might be considered uncivil, and make it clear that you want to move on and focus on the content issue. If a conflict continues to bother you, take advantage of Wikipedia's dispute resolution process. There are always users willing to mediate and arbitrate disputes between others.
In large disputes, resist the urge to turn Wikipedia into a battleground between factions. Assume good faith that every editor and group is here to improve Wikipedia—especially if they hold a point of view with which you disagree. Work with whomever you like, but do not organize a faction that disrupts (or aims to disrupt) Wikipedia's fundamental decision-making process, which is based on building a consensus. Editors in large disputes should work in good faith to find broad principles of agreement between different viewpoints.
Do not use Wikipedia to make legal or other threats against Wikipedia, Wikipedians, or the Wikimedia Foundation—other means already exist to communicate legal problems.[9] Threats are not tolerated and may result in a ban.
Wikipedia is not compulsoryPolicy shortcutsWP:CHOICEWP:NOTCOMPULSORYSee also: Wikipedia:Wikipedia is a volunteer service""WP:NOTREQUIRED"" redirects here. For ""References are not optional"" policy, see WP:OPTIONAL.Wikipedia is a volunteer community and does not require the Wikipedians to give any more time and effort than they wish. Focus on improving the encyclopedia itself, rather than demanding more from other Wikipedians. Editors are free to take a break or leave Wikipedia at any time.
And finally…Policy shortcutsWP:BADIDEAWP:NOTSTUPIDWikipedia is not any of a very long list of terrible ideas. We cannot anticipate every bad idea that someone might have. Almost everything on this page is here because somebody came up with a bad idea that had not been anticipated. (See WP:BEANS—it is, in fact, strongly discouraged to anticipate them.) In general, ""that is a terrible idea"" is always sufficient grounds to avoid doing something, provided there is a good reason that the idea is terrible.
When you wonder what to doPolicy shortcutWP:WHATISTOBEDONEWhen you wonder what should or should not be in an article, ask yourself what a reader would expect to find under the same heading in an encyclopedia.
When you wonder whether the rules given above are being violated, consider:
Modifying the content of an article (normal editing).Turning the page into a redirect, preserving the page history.Nominating the page for deletion if it meets grounds for such action under the Deletion policy page. To develop an understanding of what kinds of contributions are in danger of being deleted, you have to regularly follow discussions there.Changing the rules on this page after a consensus has been reached following appropriate discussion with other Wikipedians via the Talk page. When adding new options, please be as clear as possible and provide counter-examples of similar, but permitted, subjects.Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Common outcomes is not official policy, but can be referred to as a record of what has and has not been considered encyclopedic in the past.

Elm é uma linguagem de programação específica de domínio para criar declarativamenteinterfaces gráficas com o usuário baseadas em navegador da web .  Elm é puramente funcional e é desenvolvido com ênfase em usabilidade , desempenho e robustez .  Ele anuncia ""nenhuma exceção detempo de execução na prática"", [1] possibilitada pela verificação de tipo estático do compilador Elm.

História[editar | editar código-fonte]Elm foi inicialmente projetado por Evan Czaplicki como sua tese em 2012. [2]  O primeiro lançamento do Elm veio com muitos exemplos e um editor online que facilitou a experimentação em um navegador da web . [3]  Evan Czaplicki ingressou na Prezi em 2013 para trabalhar na Elm, [4] e em 2016 mudou para a NoRedInk como Engenheiro Open Source, também iniciando a Elm Software Foundation. [5]A implementação inicial do compilador Elm é direcionada para HTML , CSS e JavaScript . [6]  O conjunto de ferramentas principais continuou a se expandir, agora incluindo um REPL, [7]gerenciador de pacotes, [8] depurador de viagem no tempo, [9] e instaladores para Mac e Windows. [10]  Elm também tem um ecossistema de bibliotecas criadas pela comunidade [11] e um editor on-line avançado que permite trabalhos salvos e inclusão de bibliotecas comunitárias. [12]Características[editar | editar código-fonte]Elm tem um pequeno mas expressivo conjunto de construções de linguagem, incluindo expressões tradicionais, expressões de expressões para estados locais e expressões de casos para correspondência de padrões . [13]  Como linguagem funcional, suporta funções anônimas, funções como argumentos e aplicação parcial (currying) por padrão.  Sua semântica inclui valores imutáveis, funções stateless e tipagem estática com inferência de tipos.  Programas Elm renderizam HTML através de um DOM virtual e podem interoperar com outro código usando ""JavaScript como um serviço"".
Imutabilidade[editar | editar código-fonte]Todos os valores em Elm são imutáveis , o que significa que um valor não pode ser modificado depois de criado.  Elm usa estruturas de dados persistentes para implementar suas bibliotecas Array , Dict e Set . [14]Tipos estáticos[editar | editar código-fonte]Elm é estaticamente digitado.  As anotações de tipo são opcionais (devido à inferência de tipos), mas são fortemente incentivadas.  As anotações existem na linha acima da definição (diferentemente das linguagens da família C, onde tipos e nomes são intercalados).  Elm usa um único cólon para significar ""tem tipo"".
Os tipos incluem primitivos como inteiros e cadeias de caracteres e estruturas de dados básicas, como listas, tuplas e registros.  As funções têm tipos escritos com setas, por exemplo, round   : Float -> Int .  Os tipos de união permitem que o programador crie tipos personalizados para representar dados de uma maneira que corresponda ao domínio do problema. [15]Tipos podem se referir a outros tipos, por exemplo, uma List Int .  Tipos são sempre capitalizados; nomes de letras minúsculas são variáveis de tipo.  Por exemplo, uma List a é uma lista de valores de tipo desconhecido.  É o tipo da lista vazia e do argumento para List.length , que é agnóstico para os elementos da lista.  Existem alguns tipos especiais que os programadores criam para interagir com o tempo de execução Elm.  Por exemplo, Html Msg representa uma árvore DOM (virtual) cujos manipuladores de eventos produzem mensagens do tipo Msg .
Em vez de permitir que qualquer valor seja implicitamente anulável (como um ponteiro undefined ou nulo de um JavaScript), a biblioteca padrão de Elm define Maybe a tipo Maybe a .  Código que produz ou manipula um valor opcional faz isso explicitamente usando esse tipo, e todo o outro código é garantido que um valor do tipo reivindicado está realmente presente.
Sistema de módulos[editar | editar código-fonte]Elm tem um sistema de módulos que permite aos usuários quebrar o código em partes menores chamadas módulos.  Os módulos podem ocultar detalhes de implementação, como funções auxiliares, e agrupar códigos relacionados.  Os módulos servem como um namespace para código importado, como Bitwise.and .  Bibliotecas de terceiros (ou pacotes) consistem em um ou mais módulos e estão disponíveis na Biblioteca Pública Elm .  Todas as bibliotecas são versionadas de acordo com o semver , que é aplicado pelo compilador e outras ferramentas.  Ou seja, remover uma função ou alterar seu tipo só pode ser feito em uma versão principal.
Interoperabilidade com HTML, CSS e JavaScript[editar | editar código-fonte]Elm usa uma abstração chamada ports para se comunicar com JavaScript . [16]  Ele permite que os valores entrem e saiam dos programas Elm, possibilitando a comunicação entre Elm e JavaScript.
Elm tem uma biblioteca chamada elm-html que um programador pode usar para escrever HTML e CSS dentro do Elm. [17]  Ele usa uma abordagem DOM virtual para tornar as atualizações eficientes. [18]Limitações[editar | editar código-fonte]Ao contrário do Haskell ou do PureScript, o Elm não tem suporte para tipos mais sofisticados e, portanto, não pode fornecer abstrações genéricas para muitas operações comuns. [19]  Por exemplo, não há uma função genérica de map , apply , fold ou filter .  Em vez disso, esses nomes são usados como prefixo de seu módulo, como List.map e Dict.map .
Código de exemplo[editar | editar código-fonte]-- Este é um comentário de apenas uma linha

{- Este é um comentário de várias linhas   Bloco de comentário com várias linhas-}

{- É possível agrupar múltiplas linhas -}

-- Aqui foi definido uma variável ''greeting'' do tipo Stringgreeting=
    ""Hello World!""

 -- É melhor adicionar o tipo das anotações nas declarações ao topohello:Stringhello=
    ""Hi there.""

-- Funções são declaradas da mesma forma e os argumentos seguem o nome padrão da funçãoaddxy=
    x+y

-- Novamente o ideal é adicionar o tipo das anotaçõeshypotenuse:Float->Float->Floathypotenuseab=
    sqrt(a^2+b^2)

-- Funções também manipulam vários argumentos de uma vez, aqui um caso da função de multiplicação-- Operador infico com ""2""multiplyBy2:number->numbermultiplyBy2=
    (*)2

-- Expressões if são usadas para desviar valoresabsoluteValue:number->numberabsoluteValuenumber=
    ifnumber<0thennegatenumberelsenumber

 -- Registros são usados para manter valores com campos nomeadosbook:{title:String,author:String,pages:Int}book=
    {title=""Steppenwolf""
    ,author=""Hesse""
    ,pages=237
    }

-- Acesso de registro é feito com "".""title:Stringtitle=
    book.title

-- Acesso de registro ""."" também pode ser usado como uma funçãoauthor:Stringauthor=
    .authorbook

-- Podemos criar tipos novos com a palavra-chave ""type""-- O valor a seguir representa uma árvore bináriatypeTreea
    =Empty

-- É possível inpecionar esses tipos com expressões ""case""depth:Treea->Intdepthtree=

歴史[編集]Elmは2012年にEvan Czaplickiの修士論文として最初に設計された。[3]最初のElmは多くのサンプルコードとそれらをブラウザで簡単に試すことの出来るオンラインエディタとともにリリースされた。[4]Evan CzaplickiはElm開発のため2013年にPreziに入社[5]、2016年からはオープンソースエンジニアとしてNoRedInkに所属し、同時にElmソフトウェア財団を立ち上げた。[6]最初の実装ではElmコンパイラはHTML・CSS・JavaScriptをターゲットとしていた。[7]一連のツールはその後も拡張を続けており、現在はREPL、[8]パッケージマネージャー、[9]タイムトラベルデバッガー、[10]MacとWindows向けのインストーラーを備えている。[11]Elmはまたコミュニティ製ライブラリを提供するエコシステムを持っている。[12]特徴[編集]Elmは小さいながらも表現力豊かな言語の構成要素（if式、let式、case式、匿名関数）を持っている。[13][14]さらに、不変性、静的型付け、HTML・CSS・JavaScriptとの相互運用性を主要な機能として持っている。
不変性[編集]Elmのすべての値はイミュータブルであり、一度作られた値に対して後から変更が加えることはできない。
Elmは永続データ構造を用いてArray・Dict・Setライブラリを実装している。[15]静的型[編集]Elmは静的型付けである。すべての定義にはその値を正確に表現する型注釈をつけることができる。型には以下が含まれる。
整数や文字列などのプリミティブ型リストやタプル・拡張レコードなどの基本的なデータ構造タグ付きユニオンと呼ばれるカスタム型[16]Elm は完全な型推論をもサポートしており、コンパイラは型注釈なしに型安全かどうかを判定できる。
モジュールシステム[編集]Elmはモジュールシステムを持っており、ユーザーはコードをモジュールと呼ばれる小さな単位に分割することができる。ユーザーは値をインポート・エクスポートすることができ、実装の詳細を他のプログラマが意識する必要のないように隠蔽することができる。モジュールはElmコミュニティライブラリの基礎になっている。
HTML、CSS、JavaScriptとの相互運用[編集]Elmはポートと呼ばれる抽象を用いてJavaScriptと協調することができる。[17]これによってElmとJavaScriptの間でデータのやりとりが可能になる。
Elmはelm/htmlというライブラリによってElmの内部でHTMLやCSSを扱うことができる。[18]これはVirtual DOMを使って効率的に更新を行う。[19]制限[編集]HaskellやPureScriptと違い、Elmは型クラスをサポートしていないため、多くの共通的な処理を抽象化することはできない。[20]たとえば、map、apply、fold、あるいはfilterといった汎用的な関数はない。代わりに、List.mapDict.map のように、それぞれのモジュール名でプレフィックスをつけて使う。

    elm-lang.orgElm (з англ. В'яз) — функційна мова програмування, для декларативного створеннябраузерних застосунків з графічним інтерфейсом користувача. Elm використовує стиль функційного реактивного програмування та чисто функційне програмування для того щоб сконструювати інтерфейс користувача унеможливлюючи деструктивні зміни. Синтаксис схожий на Haskell, але значно спрощений і спеціалізований. Вихідний код на Elm компілюється в нативний JavaScript. Скомпільований JavaScript містить код додатка, яке керують піддерево DOM.

Історія[ред. | ред. код]Elm спроектував Еван Чапліцькі в своїй дипломній роботі 2012 року.[3] Перший випуск Elm містив приклади та онлайн-редактор, який дозволяв досить просто спробувати мову у браузері.[4] Еван Чапліцькі приєднався до Prezi в 2013 аби продовжити роботу над Elm,[5] а в 2016 перейшов до NoRedInk як Open Source Engineer, також заснувавши «Elm Software Foundation».[6]Початкова реалізація компілятора Elm націлена на генерацію HTML, CSS, та JavaScript коду.[7] Набір інструментів мови продовжив розширюватись, і тепер включає REPL,[8]менеджер пакунків,[9] зневадник який подорожує в часі,[10] та інсталятори для Mac та Windows.[11] Elm також має екосистему бібліотек створених спільнотою.[12]Особливості[ред. | ред. код]Elm містить невеликий, але виразний набір конструкцій мови, який включає if-вирази, let-вирази, case-вирази, анонімні функції та інтерполяцію списків.[13][14]Незмінність[ред. | ред. код]Всі значення в Elm незмінні, що означає, що значення не може модифікуватись, після того як воно було створеним. Elm використовує персистентні структури даних щоб реалізувати свої бібліотеки Array, Dict, та Set.[15]Статична типізація[ред. | ред. код]Elm статично типізований. Кожному визначенню в Elm можна дати анотацію типу, яка опише точний формат значення. Типи включають:
примітивні типи, такі як числа та рядкибазові структури даних, такі як списки, кортежі та асоціативні масивипозначені об'єднання[en], які дозволяють створювати нові типи[16]Elm також підтримує повне виведення типів, тому компілятор може перевірити що програма типо-безпечна, не читаючи жодних анотацій типів.
Система модулів[ред. | ред. код]Elm має систему модулів яка дозволяє користувачам розбити свій код на менші частини, які називаються модулями. Користувачі можуть імпортувати та експортувати значення, дозволяючи приховувати деталі реалізації, щоб іншим програмістам не було потреби про них думати. Модулі складають основу сайту бібліотеки спільноти Elm: Elm Public Library[17].
Взаємодія з HTML, CSS, та JavaScript[ред. | ред. код]Elm для спілкування з JavaScript використовує абстракцію, яка називається «порти».[18]Elm також має бібліотеку, яка називається elm-html і дозволяє користувачам використовувати HTML в Elm та стилізувати його з CSS.[19] Для того щоб зміни в HTML були ефективними, використовується віртуальний DOM.[20]Обмеження[ред. | ред. код]На відміну від Haskell, Elm не має підтримки класів типів[en], і тому не може надавати загальну абстракцію для багатьох типових операцій.[21] Наприклад, нема загальної функції map, apply, fold, чи filter. Замість цього, такі імена містять свій модуль як префікс, як в List.map та Dict.map.
Інструменти[ред. | ред. код]Онлайн-редактор і компілятор на elm-lang.org/tryОнлайн REPL: http://elmrepl.cuberoot.in/Elm Platform для інсталяції основних інструментів локальноTime-Traveling DebuggerРесурси для навчання та прикладиCore Libraries та Community LibrariesПриклад коду[ред. | ред. код]-- Це однорядковий коментар

起源[编辑]  一套ERP軟體概念是由產業科技研究企業－高德纳咨询公司 於1990年代初期依據資訊科技發展及供應鏈管理所提出，推論製造業管理資訊系統的發展趨勢。ERP並不是一個全新的系統，它是1970年代的物料需求計劃（MRP），1980年代的製造資源規劃（MRP II）逐漸演進而成。[4]美國生產及存貨管理協會對ERP一詞的解釋提到：一個ERP系統和典型MRP II系統的差異在技術上的需求，例如圖形使用者介面、關聯式資料庫、與客戶及供應商的整合、可視需要製作各式報告等。[5]簡單地說，ERP是「一個大型模組化、整合性的流程導向系統，整合企業內部財務會計、製造、進銷存等資訊流，快速提供決策資訊，提升企業的營運績效與快速反應能力。」它是e化企業的後台心臟與骨幹。任何前台的應用系統包括EC、客户关系管理（CRM）、供应链管理（SCM）等都以它為基礎。[6]扩充[编辑]ERP系统在上世纪90年代经历了快速增长。由于2000年问题和欧元的引进，原有系统受到扰乱，因而许多企业在这段时间用ERP替换了原有系统[7]。
“ERP II”一词是于2000年由高德纳出版在题为“ERP已死，ERP II万岁”的一篇文章中所创造的词[8]。它描述的是一个基于Web的软件，允许员工和合作伙伴（如供应商和客户）实时访问ERP系统。ERP II在传统ERP的基础上拓展了资源优化和事务处理（Transaction processing）。ERP II利用其管理下的资源信息，帮助企业与其他企业合作，而不仅仅是管理购买，销售等传统任务[9]。ERP II比第一代的ERP更加灵活。相比于传统ERP系统的功能局限于组织内，ERP II超越了企业的边界，得以与其他系统进行交互。这样的系统也被称为“企业应用套件”（Enterprise application suite）。
现在，开发人员做出更多的努力把移动设备与ERP系统集成。ERP厂商扩展ERP到这些设备，与其他业务应用程序一起。现代ERP技术相关者集成关注的硬件，应用程序，网络，和供应链。ERP现已覆盖更多的功能和作用，包括决策，利益相关者的关系，标准化，透明化，和全球化等[10]。
ERP的管理思想[编辑]其核心思想是实现对整个供应链的有效管理，主要体现在以下三个方面：
体现对整个供应链资源进行管理的思想。体现精益生产、同步工程和敏捷制造的思想。体现事先计划与事中控制的思想。功能模組[编辑]  一些典型ERP模块的图示ERP系统涵盖了以下常见功能领域。在许多ERP系统中，这些功能领域被命名并组合在一起作为ERP模块：
生产管理：工程、材料清单（bill of materials）、调度、产能、工作流管理、质量控制、成本管理、生产过程、生产工程、生产流程、生产配置、产品生命周期管理進銷存貨管理：库存、订单输入、采购、供应商调度、货物检查、付款请求处理、佣金计算财务管理及會計项目：总帳、现金管理、应付帳款管理、应收帳款管理、票據資金管理、固定资产管理成本管理：账单、时间和支出、活动管理人力资源管理：人力资源、薪金名册、培训管理、員工班別和出勤管理、津贴、勞健保、績效考核供应链管理：和客户、供应商、员工之间的各种自服务接口，採購，存貨，处理索赔，仓储（收货，上架，拣货和包装）项目管理：项目规划，资源规划，项目花费，工作分解结构，发票，时间和费用，业绩单元，活动管理客户关系管理（CRM）：销售和市场营销，佣金，服务，客户联络，呼叫中心支持 - CRM系统并不总是被认为ERP系统的一部分，而是业务支撑系统（BSS）。数据服务：为客户，供应商及/或雇员的各种“自我服务”的界面组件[编辑]事务型数据库管理门户/仪表板系統整合性[编辑]一般ERP软件強調如下之系統整合性：
所有的应用应该接入同一个数据库，以避免数据的冗余和数据定义的重复。所有的模块应该具有一致的体验。用户应该可以接入（通过获得一定的权限而能够查看）任何系统中的消息而不需要額外的處理作業
新型ERP管理系统的扩充点与主要特点如下：
企业资源计划更加因市场、销售经营的即时性，能够对市场快速响应；它将供应商、制造商与分销商间的新的伙伴关系，将流水应链管理功能包含了进来，强调即时供应即时生产；并且新的电子办公即时通讯，电子审批，企业后勤管理加入了ERP管理。先进图形用户界面、多交互式界面、自定义的桌面管理界面、第四代语言及辅助工具、分布式结构服务器、基于WEB技术的电子数据交换、多数据库集成、等等。产品数据管理PDM功能，增加了对设计数据与过程的管理，并进一步加强了生产管理系统与CAD、CAM系统的集成。流程制造等)的管理模式。新形式下ERP系统在供应链管理、销售与市场、分销、客户服务、财务管理、制造管理、库存管理、质量管理、项目管理、电子办公管理，电子文档管与标准和过程控制等补充功能。新型办公设备的加入加速了ERP的即时性，PDA、手机、高清摄像头等使条码入录管理、二维码快速导入、电子办公文件的快速跨地管理与审批。
ERP在信息与数据的时代是现代企业向国际发展的更高层管理模式，它将完成企业各方面的集成管理，给企业带来更多即时、更广泛、更长远的经济效益与社会效益。

Early life[edit]Morris was born in 1965 to parents Robert Morris and Anne Farlow Morris. The senior Morris was a computer scientist at Bell Labs, who helped design Multics and Unix; and later became the chief scientist at the National Computer Security Center, a division of the National Security Agency (NSA).
Morris grew up in the Millington section of Long Hill Township, New Jersey,[8] and graduated from Delbarton School in 1983.[9]Morris attended Harvard University, and later went on to graduate school at Cornell University. During his first year there, he designed a computer worm that disrupted many computers on what was then a fledgling internet. This led to him being indicted a year later.
After serving his conviction term, he returned to Harvard to complete his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) under the supervision of H.T. Kung. He finished in 1999.
Morris worm[edit]Main article: Morris wormMorris' computer worm was developed in 1988, while he was a graduate student at Cornell University.[10] He released the worm from MIT, rather than from Cornell.[10] The worm exploited several vulnerabilities to gain entry to targeted systems, including:
A hole in the debug mode of the Unixsendmail programA buffer overflow or overrun hole in the fingerd network serviceThe transitive trust enabled by people setting up network logins with no password requirements via remote execution (rexec) with Remote Shell (rsh), termed rexec/rshThe worm was programmed to check each computer it found to determine if the infection was already present. However, Morris believed that some system administrators might try to defeat the worm by instructing the computer to report a false positive. To compensate for this possibility, Morris programmed the worm to copy itself anyway, 14% of the time, no matter what the response was to the infection-status interrogation.
This level of persistence was a design flaw: it created system loads that brought it to the attention of administrators, and disrupted the target computers. During the ensuing trial, it was estimated that the cost in ""potential loss in productivity"" caused by the worm and efforts to remove it from different systems ranged from $200 to $53,000.[10]Criminal prosecution[edit]In 1989, Morris was indicted for violating United States Code Title 18 (18 U.S.C. § 1030), the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).[2] He was the first person to be indicted under this act. In December 1990, he was sentenced to three years of probation, 400 hours of community service, and a fine of $10,050 plus the costs of his supervision. He appealed, but the motion was rejected the following March.[4] Morris' stated motive during the trial was ""to demonstrate the inadequacies of current security measures on computer networks by exploiting the security defects [he] had discovered.""[2] He completed his sentence as of 1994.
Later life and work[edit]Morris' principal research interest is computer network architectures which includes work on distributed hash tables such as Chord and wireless mesh networks such as Roofnet.
He is a longtime friend and collaborator of Paul Graham. Along with cofounding two companies, Graham dedicated his book ANSI Common Lisp to Morris, and named the programming language that generates the online stores' web pages RTML (Robert T. Morris Language) in his honor. Graham lists Morris as one of his personal heroes, saying ""he's never wrong.""[11]Timeline[edit]1983 – Graduated from Delbarton School in Morristown, New Jersey[9]1987 – Received his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) from Harvard University.1988 – Released the Morris worm (when he was a graduate student at Cornell University)1989 – Indicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) of 1986 on July 26, 1989; the first person to be indicted under the Act1990 – Convicted in United States v.

"17 December 2020, at 04:32","For the definition of independent source when evaluating notability of a corporation or organization, see Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies) § Independent sources.This is an explanatory supplement to the multiple policies and guidelines.  This page is intended to provide additional information about concepts in the page(s) it supplements. This page is not one of Wikipedia's policies or guidelines, as it has not been thoroughly vetted by the community.ShortcutsWP:ISWP:INDYWP:INDEPENDENTIdentifying and using independent sources (also called third-party sources) helps editors build non-promotional articles that fairly portray the subject, without undue attention to the subject's own views. Using independent sources helps protect the project from people using Wikipedia for self-promotion, personal financial benefit, and other abuses. Reliance on independent sources ensures that an article can be written from a balanced, disinterested viewpoint rather than from the subject's own viewpoint or from the viewpoint of people with an axe to grind. Emphasizing the views of disinterested sources is necessary to achieve a neutral point of view in an article.  It also ensures articles can catalog a topic's worth and its role and achievements within society, rather than offering a directory listing or the contents of a sales brochure.
In determining the type of source, there are three separate, basic characteristics to identify:
Is this source self-published or not?  (For this question, see Wikipedia:Identifying and using self-published sources.)Is this source independent or third-party, or is it closely affiliated with the subject?Is this source primary or not?  (For this question, see Wikipedia:Identifying and using primary and secondary sources.)Every possible combination of these three traits has been seen in sources on Wikipedia. Any combination of these three traits can produce a source that is usable for some purpose in a Wikipedia article.  Identifying these characteristics will help you determine how you can use these sources.
This page deals primarily with the second question: identifying and using independent and non-independent sources.

Independent sources have editorial independence (advertisers do not dictate content) and no conflicts of interest (there is no potential for personal, financial, or political gain to be made from the existence of the publication).
Interest in a topic becomes vested when the source (the author, the publisher, etc.) develops any financial or legal relationship to the topic. An interest in this sense may be either positive or negative. An example of a positive interest is writing about yourself, your family, or a product that is made or sold by your company or employer; an example of a negative interest is owning or working for a company that represents a competing product's article. These conflicts of interest make Wikipedia editors suspect that sources from these people will give more importance to advancing their own interests (personal, financial, legal, etc.) in the topic than to advancing knowledge about the topic. Sources by involved family members, employees, and officers of organizations are not independent.
Independence does not imply even-handedness. An independent source may hold a strongly positive or negative view of a topic or an idea. For example, a scholar might write about literacy in developing countries, and he may personally strongly favor teaching all children how to read, regardless of gender or socioeconomic status. Yet if the author gains no personal benefit from the education of these children, then the publication is an independent source on the topic.
Material available from sources that are self-published, primary sources, or biased because of a conflict of interest can play a role in writing an article, but it must be possible to source the information that establishes the subject's real-world notability to independent, third-party sources. Reliance on independent sources ensures that an article can be written from a balanced, disinterested viewpoint rather than from the person's own viewpoint. It also ensures articles can catalogue a topic's worth, its role and achievements within society, rather than offering a directory listing or the contents of a sales brochure.
Articles that don't reference independent sources should be tagged with {{third-party}}, and if no substantive coverage in independent reliable secondary sources can be identified then the article should be nominated for deletion. If the article's content is strictly promotional, it should even be made a candidate for speedy deletion under criterion WP:CSD G11.
Explanation[edit]Wikipedia strives to be of the highest standard possible, and to avoid writing on topics from a biased viewpoint. Wikipedia:Verifiability was created as an expansion of the neutral point of view policy, to allow information to be checked for any form of bias.  It has been noticed, however, that some articles are sourcing their content solely from the topic itself, which creates a level of bias within an article. Where this primary source is the only source available on the topic, this bias is impossible to correct. Such articles tend to be vanity pieces, although it is becoming increasingly hard to differentiate this within certain topic areas.
If Wikipedia is, as defined by the three key content policies, an encyclopaedia which summarises viewpoints rather than a repository for viewpoints, to achieve this goal, articles must demonstrate that the topic they are covering has been mentioned in reliable sources independent of the topic itself. These sources should be independent of both the topic and of Wikipedia, and should be of the standard described in Wikipedia:Reliable sources. Articles should not be built using only vested-interest sources. This requirement for independent sources is so as to determine that the topic can be written about without bias; otherwise the article is likely to fall foul of our vanity guidelines.
Examples[edit]In the case of a Wikipedia article about a website, for example, independent sources would include an article in a newspaper which describes the site, but a reference to the site itself would lack independence (and would instead be considered a primary source).
Examples of independent and non-independent sources for some common subjects
You're writing about…
Independent
Non-independent
a business
News media, government agency
Owner, employees, corporate website or press release, sales brochure, competitor's website
a person
News media, popular or scholarly book
Person, family members, friends, employer, employees
a city
National media, textbook, encyclopedias, other reference works
Mayor's website, local booster clubs, local chamber of commerce website
a book, music recording, movie
Newspaper or magazine review, book (or chapter)
Production company website, publishing company website, website for the book/album/movie, album sleeve notes, book jacket copy, autobiography by the musician, actor, etc.
These simple examples need to be interpreted with all the facts and circumstances in mind. For example, a newspaper that depends on advertising revenue might not be truly independent in their coverage of the local businesses that advertise in the paper. As well, a newspaper owned by person X might not be truly independent in its coverage of person X and her business activities.
Every article on Wikipedia must be based upon verifiable statements from multiple third-party reliable sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. A third-party source is one that is entirely independent of the subject being covered, e.g., a newspaper reporter covering a story that they are not involved in except in their capacity as a reporter. The opposite of a third-party source is a first-party or non-independent source. A first-party, non-independent source about the president of an environmental lobby group would be a report published by that lobby group's communications branch. A third-party source is not affiliated with the event, not paid by the people who are involved, and not otherwise likely to have a conflict of interest related to the material.
This concept is contrasted with the unrelated concept of a secondary source, which is one where the material presented is based on some other original material, e.g., a non-fiction book analyzing original material such as news reports, and with a primary source, where the source is the wellspring of the original material, e.g., an autobiography or a politician's speech about his or her own campaign goals. Secondary does not mean third-party, and primary does not mean non-independent or affiliated with the subject.  Secondary sources are often third-party or independent sources, but they are not always third-party sources.
Although there is technically a small distinction between a third-party source and an independent one, most of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines use the terms interchangeably, and most sources that are third-party also happen to be independent. Note that a third party is not necessarily independent. For example, if famous filmmaker Y has a protege who runs a film review website (""Fully Independent Critic.com""), and if filmmaker Y instructs ""Independent Critic"" to praise or attack film Q, then filmmaker and Y and Fully Independent Critic.com might not be independent, even though they are not related by ownership, contract or any legal means.
Why independent sources are required[edit]Independent sources are a necessary foundation for any article. Although Wikipedia is not paper, it is also not a dumping ground for any and all information that readers consider important or useful. For the sake of neutrality, Wikipedia cannot rely upon any editor's opinion about what topics are important. Everything in Wikipedia must be verified in reliable sources, including statements about what subjects are important and why. To verify that a subject is important, only a source that is independent of the subject can provide a reliable evaluation. A source too close to the subject will always believe that the subject is important enough to warrant detailed coverage, and relying exclusively upon this source will present a conflict of interest and a threat to a neutral encyclopedia.
Arguably, an independent and reliable source is not always objective enough or knowledgeable to evaluate a subject. There are many instances of biased coverage by journalists, academics, and critics. Even with peer review and fact-checking, there are instances where otherwise reliable publications report complete falsehoods. But Wikipedia does not allow editors to improve an article with their own criticisms or corrections. Rather, if a generally reliable source makes a false or biased statement, the hope is that another reliable source can be found to refute that statement and restore balance. (In severe cases, a group of editors will agree to remove the verified but false statement, but without adding any original commentary in its place.)
If multiple reliable publications have discussed a topic, or better still debated a topic, then that improves the topic's probability of being covered in Wikipedia. First, multiple sources that have debated a subject will reliably demonstrate that the subject is worthy of notice. Second, and equally important, these reliable sources will allow editors to verify certain facts about the subject that make it significant, and write an encyclopedic article that meets our policies and guidelines.
Non-independent sources[edit]ShortcutWP:NIS  The Bippledorp 9000's man­u­fac­turer calls it ""a landmark in the history of music and the most leg­end­ary pedal in rock""; an in­de­pend­ent magazine review may call it ""a meh"".Non-independent sources may be used to source content for articles, but the connection of the source to the topic must be clearly identified. i.e. ""The organization X said 10,000 people showed up to protest."" is OK when using material published by the organization, but ""10,000 people showed up to protest."" is not. Similarly, it is undesirable to say ""Pax-Luv is the top tranquilizer"" (without attribution) instead of ""Pax-Luv's manufacturer, Umbrella Cor., says Pax-Luv is the top tranquilizer"".
Press releases[edit]ShortcutWP:PRSOURCEA press release is clearly not an independent source as it is usually written either by the business or organization it is written about, or by a business or person hired by or affiliated with the organization (e.g., a spin doctor). Press releases commonly show up in Google News searches and other searches that editors commonly use to locate reliable sources. Usually, but not always, a press release will be identified as such. Many less reputable news sources will write an article based almost exclusively on a press release, making only minor modifications. When using news sources whose editorial integrity you are uncertain of, and an article reads like a press release, it is crucial to check to see that the source is not simply recycling a press release (a practice called ""churnalism""). Sometimes, but not always, it is possible to locate the original press release used to generate the article.
In general, press releases have effusive praise, rather than factual statements. A press release about the Bippledorp 9000 effect pedal by its manufacturer might call it the ""greatest invention in the history of electric guitar""; in contrast, an independent review in Guitar Player magazine may simply make factual statements about its features and call it an ""incremental tweak to existing pedal features"".
Syndicated stories[edit]ShortcutWP:SYNDICATEDThere are companies that generate television segments and sell them to broadcasters – this is broadcast syndication. This also happens in printed media and across websites. A syndication company may offer the same story in multiple formats, such as a long and short news article, or the same story with an alternate lead, or a video and a  written article. Whatever the length or format, they usually contain the same claims and are written or edited by the same person or team.
Syndicated news pieces may be independent of the subject matter, but they are not independent of one another. When considering notability or due weight within an article, all of the related articles by the same publishing syndicate, no matter how widely they were sold, are treated as the same single source.  (See also: Wikipedia:Notability#cite ref-3.)
Conflicts of interest[edit]ShortcutWP:COISOURCEAny publication put out by an organization is clearly not independent of any topic that organization has an interest in promoting. In some cases, the conflict of interest is easy to see. For example, suppose Foo Petrochemicals Inc. wrote an article about a chemical spill caused by Foo Petrochemicals Inc.. This is not an independent source on the spill, nor on how ""green"", nature-loving and environment-saving Foo is. If the source is written by a public relations firm hired by Foo, it's the same as if it were written by Foo itself. Foo and the hired PR firm both have a conflict of interest between a) being accurate and b) favouring Foo.
However, less direct interests can be harder to see and more subjective to establish. Caution must be used in accepting sources as independent. Suppose a non-profit organization named ""Grassroots Reach-out Accountability Sustainability (""GRASS"") writes a press release calling Foo Petrochemicals ""the #1 savior of the environment and the planet"". Does GRASS have a conflict of interest? Well, the GRASS.com website says GRASS is 100% independent and community-based. However, closer research may reveal that GRASS was astroturfed by unnamed corporations who gave the organization lots of money to pursue these ""independent"" agendas. US funding laws allow such anonymity; many other countries have stricter transparency laws. Covert ads are illegal or restricted in many jurisdictions.
The peer-review process does not guarantee independence of a source. Journal policies on conflicts of interest vary. Caution is needed on topics with large commercial interests at stake, where controversy may be manufactured, and genuinely controversial topics where there may be a great deal of honest debate and dissent. Much scientific research is funded by companies with an interest in the outcome of the experiments, and such research makes its way into peer-reviewed journals. For example, pharmaceutical companies may fund research on their new medication Pax-Luv. If you are a scientist doing research funded by the manufacturer of Pax-Luv, you may be tempted (or pressured) into downplaying adverse information about the drug; resistance may lose you your funding. Journals themselves can also have conflicts of interest, due to their funding sources; some profit from paid supplements, and some predatory journals have no real peer-review. See conflicts of interest in academic publishing. 
Independent studies, if available, are to be preferred. It may be best to include a source with a potential conflict of interest; in this case, it's important to identify the connection between the source and topic: ""A study by X found that Y.""
No guarantee of reliability[edit]Independence alone is not a guarantee that the source is accurate or reliable for a given purpose. Independent sources may be outdated, self-published, mistaken, or not have a reputation for fact-checking.
Outdated: A book from 1950 about how asbestos fibre insulation is 100% safe for your house's roof may be published by a source which is completely independent from the asbestos mining and asbestos insulation industries. However, as of 2018, this 1950 book is outdated.Self-published: A book by a self-proclaimed ""International Insulation Expert"", Foo Barkeley, may claim that asbestos fibre insulation is totally safe, and that we should all have fluffy heaps of asbestos fibre in our roofs and walls. However, if Foo Barkeley has paid the vanity press company ""You Pay, We Print It!"" to print 100,000 copies of his treatise praising asbestos, then we don't know if Barkeley's views on asbestos are reliable.Mistaken: The world's most elite effect pedal experts, the International Guitar Pedal Institute, may declare in 1989 that the ""Bippledorp 9000 pedal is the first pedal to use a fuzz bass effect""; however, in 2018, new research may show that fuzz bass effects were available in pedal formats in the 1970s.Not good reputation for fact-checking: A tabloid newspaper, the Daily Truth, may declare that a film celebrity, Fingel Stempleton, was kidnapped by space aliens and taken to their home planet for probing/surgery for the entire day of January 1, 2018. DT may make this claim based on an interview with a guest at Stempleton's mansion who witnessed the UFO's arrival in the gated Stempleton mansion/compound. However, a major newspaper with a reputation for fact-checking counters this claim with the release of 60 days of police video surveillance showing Stempleton was locked up for drunk driving from December 1, 2017 to January 30, 2018. (Hmmm, perhaps Stempleton used a Jedi astral travel trick to get out of lockup?)Relationship to notability[edit]Non-independent sources may not be used to establish notability. The core policy Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not requires that it be possible to verify a subject with at least one independent source, or else the subject may not have a separate article in Wikipedia. There is no requirement that every article currently contain citations to such sources, although it is highly desirable.
Indiscriminate sources[edit]Some sources, while apparently independent, are indiscriminate sources. For example, a travel guide might attempt to provide a review for every single point of interest, restaurant, or hotel in a given area. A newspaper in a small town might write about the opening and closing of every single business in the town, or the everyday activities of local citizens. An enthusiastic local music reviewer may pen a review of every single person who comes on stage in their town with a guitar and a microphone, whether it is an amateur garage band playing for the first time or a major touring group. Sometimes, WP editors think that because a reliable source mentions a certain band, book, film or other topic, this confers notability on the book, film or other topic. Not necessarily. The New York Times may state that Foo Barkeley was onstage at a rock concert (""Foo Barkeley was one of the opening acts who performed on May 1, 2017 at the venue"". This is arguably a ""bare mention""; yes the NYT says that Foo performed, but they don't say whether the concert was good or noteworthy.
Indiscriminate but independent sources may be reliable – for example, an online travel guide may provide accurate information for every single hotel and restaurant in a town – but the existence of this information should be considered skeptically when determining due weight and whether each of the mentioned locations qualifies for a separate, standalone article. If a subject, such as a local business, is only mentioned in indiscriminate independent sources, then it does not qualify for a separate article on Wikipedia, but may be mentioned briefly in related articles (e.g., the local business may be mentioned in the article about the town where it is located).
Articles without third-party sources[edit]An article that currently is without third-party sources should not always be deleted. The article may merely be in an imperfect state, and someone may only need to find the appropriate sources to verify the subject's importance. Consider asking for help with sources at the article's talk page, or at the relevant WikiProject. Also consider tagging the article with an appropriate template, such as {{Third-party}} or {{unreferenced}}.
If no amount of searching will remedy this lack of sources, then it may still be possible to preserve some of the information by merging it into another broad topic. But in order to avoid undue weight, the subject may first need to be summarized appropriately. Consider starting a merge discussion, using the template {{merge}}.
Otherwise, if deleting:
If the article meets our criteria for speedy deletion, one can use a criterion-specific deletion tag listed on that page.Use the {{prod}} tag, for articles which do not meet the criteria for speedy deletion, but are uncontroversial deletion candidates. This allows the article to be deleted after seven days if nobody objects. For more information, see Wikipedia:Proposed deletion.For cases where you are unsure about deletion or believe others might object, nominate the article for the articles for deletion process, where the merits will be debated and deliberated for at least seven days.Some articles do not belong on Wikipedia, but fit one of the Wikimedia sister projects. They may be copied there using transwiki functionality before considering their merger or deletion. If an article to be deleted is likely to be re-created under the same name, it may be turned into a soft redirect to a more appropriate sister project's article.
Related concepts[edit]Relationship to primary and secondary sources[edit]This concept is contrasted with the unrelated concept of a secondary source. A secondary source derives its material from some other, original material, e.g., a non-fiction book analyzing original material such as news reports. Secondary sources are contrasted with primary sources. Primary sources are the wellspring of the original material, e.g., an autobiography, a politician's speech about his or her own campaign goals or quoted material from a holy text. Secondary does not mean independent, and primary does not mean non-independent or affiliated with the subject. Secondary sources are often third-party or independent sources, but not always.
Relationship to self-published sources[edit]This concept is unrelated to whether a source is self-published. A self-published source is made available to the public (""published"") by or at the direction of the person or entity that created it. Blog posts by consumers about their personal experiences with a product are completely independent, self-published sources. A peer-reviewed article in an reputable academic journal by researchers at a pharmaceutical company about one of their products is a non-independent, non-self-published source.
Biased sources[edit]  It doesn't matter if you love it or hate it. If you aren't selling it, you're probably an independent source about it.A source can be biased without compromising its independence. When a source strongly approves or disapproves of something, but it has no connection to the subject and does not stand to benefit directly from promoting that view, then the source is still independent.
In particular, many academic journals are sometimes said to be ""biased"", but the fact that education journals are in favor of education, pharmaceutical journals are in favor of pharmaceutical drugs, journals about specific regions write about the people and places in that region, etc., does not mean that these sources are non-independent, or even biased. What matters for independence is whether they stand to gain from it. For example, a drug company publishing about their own products in a pharmaceutical journal is a non-independent source. The same type of article, written by a government researcher, would be an independent source.
Third-party versus independent[edit]There is technically a small distinction between a third-party source and an independent one. An ""independent"" source is one that has no vested interest in the subject. For example, the independent source will not earn any extra money by convincing readers of its viewpoint. A ""third-party"" source is one that is not directly involved in any transaction related to the subject, but may still have a financial or other vested interest in the outcome. For example, if a lawsuit between two people may result in one person's insurance company paying a claim, then that insurance company is a third party but is not financially independent.
However, most of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines use the terms interchangeably, and most published sources that are third-party also happen to be independent. Except when directly specified otherwise in the policy or guideline, it is sufficient for a source to be either independent or third-party, and it is ideal to rely on sources that are both.
Wikipedia's requirements[edit]Policies and guidelines requiring third-party sources[edit]The necessity of reliable, third-party sources is cemented in several of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines:
Wikipedia's policy on What Wikipedia is not states that ""All article topics must be verifiable with independent, third-party sources"".Wikipedia's policies on both Verifiability and No original research state that ""If no reliable, third-party sources can be found for an article topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it.""Wikipedia's policy on Verifiability states that ""Articles should be based upon reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.""Wikipedia's guideline on Notability states that ""If a topic has received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject, it is presumed to satisfy the inclusion criteria for a stand-alone article.""How to meet the requirement[edit]An article must be based upon reliable third-party sources, and meets this requirement if:
Reliable: A third-party source is reliable if it has standards of peer review and fact-checking. In general, the more people engaged in checking facts, the more reliable the publication.Third-party: A third-party source is independent and unaffiliated with the subject, thus excluding first-party sources such as self-published material by the subject, autobiographies, and promotional materials.Sources: At least two third-party sources should cover the subject, to avoid idiosyncratic articles based upon a single perspective.Based upon: These reliable third-party sources should verify enough facts to write a non-stub article about the subject, including a statement explaining its significance.Once an article meets this minimal standard, additional content can be verified using any reliable source. However, any information that violates What Wikipedia is not must be removed, regardless of whether or not it is  verified in reliable third-party sources.

"Цю сторінку востаннє відредаговано о 18:03, 23 серпня 2020.","Планува́ння ресу́рсів підприє́мства (ERP-система) (англ.Enterprise Resource Planning System — Система планування ресурсів підприємства) — корпоративна інформаційна система (КІС), призначена для автоматизації обліку й керування. Зазвичай ERP-системи будуються за модульним принципом і в тому або іншому ступені охоплюють всі ключові процеси діяльності компанії.
Класичні системи ERP забезпечують керування задачами:
керування фінансами;керування виробництвом;керування формуванням та розподілом запасів;керування реалізацією та маркетингом;керування утриманням покупцівкерування постачанням;керування проектами;керування сервісним обслуговуванням;керування процедурами забезпечення якості продукції.Зміст1Історія1.1Кіпу інків2Концепція ERP3ERP-системи3.1Впровадження3.2Переваги3.3Недоліки3.4Зарубіжні ERP-системи3.5Українські ERP-системи4Примітки5Див. також6Посилання7Література

Історія[ред. | ред. код]Кіпу інків[ред. | ред. код]Для передачі економіко-статистичних даних кіпу використовували подвійний запис [1], а при передачі відомостей про виробництво тих або інших продуктів праці враховували не тільки фактичну, але й наявну й потенційну продуктивність праці, що дозволяє вважати систему кіпу попередницею сучасних ERP-систем. От що писав відомий дослідник андських цивілізацій В. А. Кузьміщев:
Кіпу «знали», скільки людей проживало в кожному із селищ і у всьому царстві, скільки з них було чоловічої й жіночої статі, як вони були розбиті за віком і за станом здоров'я, скільки серед них було одружених і вдів, скільки пішло на війну й на суспільні роботи, скільки людей і якою роботою займалися сьогодні й скільки вони могли зробити того або іншого продукту і так далі. Але не тільки люди й результати їхньої праці, а сама природа і її потенційні можливості були зафіксовані в кіпу[2]Концепція ERP[ред. | ред. код]Історично концепція ERP стала розвитком простіших концепцій MRP (Material Requirement Planning — Планування матеріальних потреб) і MRP II (Manufacturing Resource Planning — Планування виробничих ресурсів). Ще використовується в ERP-системах програмний інструментарій, який дозволяє проводити виробниче планування, моделювати потік замовлень і оцінювати можливість їхньої реалізації в службах і підрозділах підприємства, пов'язуючи його зі збутом.
ERP-системи[ред. | ред. код]Впровадження[ред. | ред. код]Класичні ERP-системи, на відміну від так званого програмного забезпечення «в коробці», належать до категорії «важких» замовних програмних продуктів — їхні вибір, придбання і впровадження зазвичай вимагають ретельного планування в рамках тривалого проекту з участю партнерської компанії — постачальника або консультанта. Оскільки КІС будуються за модульним принципом, замовник часто (принаймні, на ранній стадії таких проектів) купує не повний спектр модулів, а обмежений їхній комплект. У ході впровадження проектна команда зазвичай протягом декількох місяців (до року) здійснює налаштування модулів, що поставляються.
Переваги[ред. | ред. код]Використання ERP системи дозволяє використовувати одну інтегровану програму замість декількох розрізнених. Єдина система може керувати обробкою, логістикою, дистрибуцією, запасами, доставкою, виставлянням рахунків, бухгалтерским обліком, податковим обліком, програмою лояльності. 
Реалізована в ERP-системах система розмежування доступу до інформації, призначена (в комплексі з іншими заходами інформаційної безпеки підприємства) для протидії як зовнішнім загрозам (наприклад промисловому шпигунству), так і внутрішнім (наприклад, розкраданням). Впроваджувані в зв'язці з CRM-системою і системою контролю якості, ERP-системи
націлені на максимальне задоволення потреб компаній в засобах управління бізнесом.
Недоліки[ред. | ред. код]Безліч проблем, пов'язаних з ERP, виникають через недостатнє інвестування в навчання персоналу, а також через недосконалість політики занесення і підтримки актуальності даних в ERP.
Обмеження і помилки:
Невеликі компанії не можуть дозволити собі інвестувати достатньо грошей в ERP і адекватно навчити всіх співробітників.Іноді ERP складно або неможливо адаптувати під документообіг компанії і її специфічні бізнес-процеси.Система може страждати від проблеми «слабої ланки» — ефективність всієї системи може бути порушена одним департаментом або партнером.Опір департаментів в наданні інформації зменшує ефективність системи.Проблема сумісності з колишніми системами.Помилки розробників у системі приводять до відчутних втрат коштів та долі на ринку.У сучасності, з популяризацією хмарних технологій, такі системи можуть бути доступні і для малого, і середнього бізнесу. Тепер підприємцям не потрібні сервери та їхня підтримка для управління бізнес-процесами. На ринку є такі рішення, як, наприклад, хмарні ОС. Навчання користувачів більше не займає так багато часу, також вирішені питання з документообігом та проблема сумісності з іншими системами.
Зарубіжні ERP-системи[ред. | ред. код]Серед найвідоміших програмних продуктів, що реалізовують концепцію ERP, слід назвати в першу чергу системи mySAP ERP, MySAP All-in-One і SAP Business One компанії SAP AG, Oracle E-Business Suite, JD Edwards і PeopleSoft Enterprise компанії Oracle. На українському ринку в сегменті середнього і малого бізнесу (SMB) утримує лідерство компанія Microsoft з системами Microsoft Dynamics АХ (Axapta) і NAV (Navision).
Також упевнено вступили на український ринок такі ERP рішення як ALTUM і ALTUM XL компанії Comarch, а також шведська ERP та CRM система Enterprise by HansaWorld.
Із інших рішень можна відзначити системи infor: ERPnext COM, MAX+, SSA ERP LN (Baan) і SyteLine від фірми Infor.
Існують також менш універсальні рішення, що роблять ставку на розширення функціональності з конкретною галузевою специфікою.
Приклад — система IFS Applications компанії IFS з розширеною функціональністю для виробництва і ремонтів.
Ряд російських та українських програмних систем також реалізують в тій чи іншій мірі функціональність вищеперелічених ERP.
Так, систему 1С:Управління підприємством 8.0 часом деякі вважають повнофункціональною ERP-системою.
Корпоративна інформаційна система (КІС) ""Парус - Підприємство 8.5"" також є яскравим прикладом російської ERP системи. Дана система використовується як у Росії, так і в Україні.
Ще приклади російських ERP систем: ІНТАЛЄВ: Корпоративний менеджмент, Флагман, Фрегат - Корпорація, АВА Системи.
Білоруська ERP і CRM система ПОТІККомпанія-розробник - VIPSOFTУкраїнські ERP-системи[ред. | ред. код]Ряд українських виробників програмного забезпечення позиціонує свої системи як ERP. Насамперед, це системи Фінексперт, IT-Підприємство[ru], Мегаполіс, BSI, Дебет Плюс, Універсал ERP.

(Ekim 2011‎)  Kurumsal kaynak planlaması yazılımları, iş dünyasında gün geçtikçe daha etkin bir yer edinmektedir.Kurumsal kaynak planlaması ya da işletme kaynak planlaması (İngilizce: Enterprise Resource Planning - ERP), işletmelerde mal ve hizmet üretimi için gereken işgücü, makine, malzeme gibi kaynakların verimli bir şekilde kullanılmasını sağlayan bütünleşik yönetim sistemlerine verilen genel addır. Kurumsal kaynak planlaması (KKP) sistemleri, bir işletmenin tüm veri ve işlemlerini bir araya getirmeye veya bir araya getirilmesine yardımcı olmaya çalışan ve genelde kullanımı kolay olan sistemlerdir. Klasik bir KKP yazılımı işlem yapabilmek için bilgisayarın çeşitli yazılım ve donanımlarını kullanır. KKP sistemleri temel olarak değişik verilerin saklanabildiği bütünleşik bir veritabanı kullanırlar.
Kurumsal kaynak planlaması anlam olarak, işletmenin tüm kaynaklarının birleştirilip, verimli olarak kullanılması için tasarlanmış sistemlere denmektedir. KKP kavramı ilk olarak üretim çevrelerinde kullanılmaya başlansa da; günümüzde KKP sistemleri çok daha geniş bir alanda telâfuz edilmektedir.  KKP sistemleri, bir işletmenin iş alanına ya da ismine bakmadan, işletmenin tüm temel işlemlerini kendi yapısı altında toplayabilir. İşletmenler, kâr amacı olmayan kuruluşlar, vakıflar, hükümetler veya diğer varlıklar KKP sistemlerini kullanabilirler.
KKP sistemleri iki veya daha fazla yazılımı bir araya getirerek bir yazılım paketi halinde de sunulabilir. Bu gibi sistemlere KKP yazılım paketleri denir. Teknik olarak ise KKP yazılım paketleri hem maaş bordro akışlarını hem de muhasebe işlevlerini bünyesinde barındırır.
Buna rağmen, KKP yazılım paketi tanımı daha çok büyük ve geniş uygulamalar için kullanılmaktadır. Bir KKP sistemi kullanıcının, iki veya daha fazla bağımsız yazılımın arayüzü ile karşılaşmasını engeller ve ek avantajlar sağlar. Yazılımların standartlaşmasını, birçok yazılım kullanmak yerine tek bir yazılım kullanılmasını, tüm veriler genellikler tek bir veritabanında saklandığından kolay ve yüksek rapor alma, durum değerlendirme gücünü sağlar.
Bir KKP yazılımı bünyesinde genelde bağımsız olarak çalışan üretim, finans, müşteri ilişkileri yönetimi, insan kaynakları, stok yönetimi gibi çeşitli uygulamalar bulunabilir.

Genel Bakış[değiştir | kaynağı değiştir]KKP sistemlerine daha yakından bakacak olursak, en önemli gerekliliğin bir işletmenin tüm bakış açılarındaki her verinin, birleştirilmesi olduğunu görürüz. KKP sistemleri bunu sağlamak için, işletmenin çeşitli iş faaliyetlerini ele alan birçok yazılım modülünü tek bir veritabanı altında çalıştırmaktadır.
Gerçekte komple bir KKP sisteminden bahsetmek çok zordur. KKP sistemlerini satın alarak, bünyelerinde uygulamak isteyen büyük işletmelerin özel ihtiyaçları vardır ve bazı özel ihtiyaçlar şu an hiçbir KKP sistemi üreticisi tarafından karşılanamamaktadır[kaynak belirtilmeli]. Bu ihtiyaçları karşılamak için güçlü bir kişiselleştirme işlemi oluşturma ve değişik üreticilerden farklı modüller satın almanın yanı sıra, işletme bu modüller üzerinde tekrar mühendislik çalışması yapmalıdır. Günümüzde ideal olarak, üretim alanında faaliyet gösteren bir işletme, alanıyla ilgili tüm konularda aynı KKP sistemini kullanmaktadır.
Tek bir veritabanı, aşağıdaki alanların da dahil olduğu çeşitli yazılım modüllerini bünyesinde barındırabilir;
Üretim:Mühendislik işlemleriMalzeme listeleme işlemleriÇizelgelemeKapasite analiziİş Emri yönetimiKalite KontrolMaliyet yönetimiÜretim işlemleriÜretim projeleriÜretim akışlarıTedarik Zinciri Yönetimi:Envanter yönetimiSipariş girişiSatınalmaÜrün yapılandırmasıTedarik zinciri planlamasıTedarikçi çizelgeleriMali Yönetim:Genel hesap defteriNakit yönetimiNakit çıkışlarıNakit girişleriDurağan varlıklarProje Yönetimi:Maliyet hesaplamaListeleme işlemleriSüre ve harcama analizleriFaaliyet yönetimiİnsan Kaynakları Yönetimi:İnsan kaynaklarıMaaş bordrolarıİşletme içi eğitimÇalışanların çalışma süresi ve devamlılığıFaydalarMüşteri İlişkileri Yönetimi:Satış ve pazarlamaKomisyonlarHizmetlerMüşteri sözleşmeleriYardım hattı desteğiMüşteriler, tedarikçiler ve çalışanlar için kişisel ve genel kullanıcı arayüzleriİnsan kaynakları planlaması terimi, orijinal olarak ""üretim kaynakları planlaması"" teriminden türetilmiştir (İngilizce Manufacturing Resource Planning - MRP). Üretim kaynakları planlaması tanımı (ÜKP) ise, yazılım mimarisinin önem kazanması ve şirket kapasite planlamasının yazılım faaliyetlerinin yer edinmesi ile KKP sistemlerine dönüşmeye başlamıştır. KKP sistemleri genellikle bir işletmenin, üretim, ulaştırma, dağıtım, envanter durumu, liman ticareti, muhasebe ve faturalama gibi işlemlerini kontrol eder. KKP yazılımları ayrıca bir işletmenin, satış, pazarlama, ulaştırma, listeleme, üretim planlaması, envanter yönetimi, kalite yönetimi ve insan kaynakları yönetimi gibi birçok ticari faaliyetini kontrol etmesine yardımcı olur.
KKP sistemleri tüm işletme işlevleri arasında geçiş yapabilen sistemlerdir. Operasyonlarda veya üretimde görev alan tüm işlevsel departmanlar tek bir sistemde birleştirilir. İmalat, depolama, taşımacılık ve ulaştırma ve bilgi teknolojilerine ek olarak, muhasebe, pazarlama, insan kaynakları ve  strateji yönetimi de KKP sistemlerinde bulunabilir.
Kurumsal Kaynak Planlaması Öncesinde[değiştir | kaynağı değiştir]KKP sistemlerinden önce, işletme departmanları kendi bilgisayar sistemlerine sahip olmalıydı. Örnek olarak, bir işletmedeki insan kaynakları departmanı, bordrolama departmanı ve mali işler departmanını verelim. İnsan kaynakları departmanı kendi bilgisayar sisteminde, tüm departman bilgilerini ve bu departmanlarda çalışanların kişisel bilgilerini tutmakla görevliydi. Bordrolama departmanı ise maaş bordrosu bilgilerini hesaplar ve tutardı. Mali işler bölümü de işletmedeki mali işlemlerin kayıtlarını  tutardı. Her sistem birbirine ortak veriler yollayarak iletişim içinde olmalıydı. Örnek verecek olursak, insan kaynakları bölümünde her çalışanın bir numarası olurdu, aynı numara bordrolama bölümünde de mevcut olmalıydı. Bu sayede insan kaynakları bölümünden, bordrolama bölümüne, çalışanın numarası ve maaş bilgisini yollanır, bilgiler bordrolama sisteminde kontrol edildikten sonra, maaş bordrosu kesilirdi. Mali işler departmanı ise çalışanların verileri ile ilgilenmez, sadece bordrolama departmanından yapılan, vergi, kesinti, işçi ücretleri vb. ödemelerle uğraşırdı. Departmanlar arasındaki bu sistem karışıklıklara yol açardı. Örneğin, ödeme sisteminde çalışan numarası olmayan bir işçiye ödeme yapılmayabiliyordu.
Kurumsal Kaynak Planlaması Sonrasında[değiştir | kaynağı değiştir]KKP yazılımları, eskiden kullanılan ve birbirinden farklı birçok uygulamanın verilerini birbirine bağladı. Bu işlem, birden fazla sistemde kayıtlı tutulan çalışan/işçi numaralarında sorun çıkma endişesini ortadan kaldırdı. Ayrıca büyük işletmelerdeki yazılım uzmanı ihtiyacı azaldı ve standart bir hale geldi. Raporlama işlemleri tek bir sistem üzerinde yapıldığından, eskiye nazaran çok daha kolay bir hal aldı. Ayrıca KKP sistemleri, işletme içindeki eğilimlerin tespit edilip, uygun ayarlamaların daha çabuk yapılmasına imkân sağlamasıyla, işletmelere yüksek seviyede analizleme işlevi sağladı.
KKP Uygulamaları[değiştir | kaynağı değiştir]İşletmelerdeki geniş uygulama kapsamı nedeniyle, KKP sistemleri mevcut büyük yazılımlardan yararlanmaktadır. Böyle büyük ve karmaşık bir yazılım sistemini işletme bünyesinde kullanabilmek için bir analizci, programcı ve kullanıcı ordusuna ihtiyaç duyulmaktaydı. İnternet gelişene kadar, şirketler dışarıdan getirilen danışmanların, standart yamaları yüklemesi için bilgisayarları kullanmasına izin verirdi. Uzman yardımı olmadan bir KKP uygulaması, büyük şirketler ve özellikle uluslararası şirketler için çok masraflı olabilmektedir. KKP uygulamalarında uzmanlaşmış şirketler ise bu işlemleri kolaylaştırabilir ve altı ay içinde pilot testler ile sistemi tamamlayabilirler.
Kurumsal kaynak planlaması sistemleri genellikle ""tedarik zinciri yönetimi"" ve ""lojistik otomasyonu"" sistemleri ile yakından ilişkilidir. Tedarik zinciri yönetimi yazılımları, KKP sistemlerini, tedarikçiler olan bağlantılar ile genişletebilir.
İşletmeler, KKP sistemlerini bünyelerinde uygulamak için genelde KKP satıcıları veya üçüncü şahıs danışmanlık şirketlerinden yardım alırlar. KKP danışmanlığı ise, sistem mimarisi, iş işlemleri danışmanlığı (yeniden mühendislik) ve teknik danışmanlık (programlama, sistem yapılandırması vb.) olmak üzere üç bölüm içermektedir. Bir sistem mimarı, bir işletmenin gelecekteki veri akışı planları da dahil olmak üzere bütün veri akışını tasarlar. İş danışmanı, işletmenin mevcut ticari işlemlerini analiz eder ve bunları KKP sisteminde karşılık gelen işlemlere eşler. Böylece KKP sistemini işletme ihtiyaçlarına göre yapılandırılmış olur. Teknik danışmanlık ise genelde programlama aşamasını içerir. Çoğu KKP satıcısı, yazılımlarında değişiklik yapılmasına izin vererek, müşterilerinin iş alanındaki ihtiyaçlarını karşılanmasını ve sistemin bu ihtiyaçlara uymasını sağlar.
Bir KKP paketini şirkete göre kişiselleştirmek hem pahalı hem de zahmetli bir iştir. Nedeni ise birçok KKP paketinin kişiselleştirmeye destek verecek şekilde tasarlanmayışıdır. Bu yüzden birçok işletme, mevcut KKP sistemi içerisindeki en iyi uygulamaları kullanır. Bazı KKP paketleri raporlama ve sorgulama işlemlerinde rahatça kişiselleştirebilir, öyle ki bu gibi kişiselleştirmeler her uygulamada beklenir. Bu paketleri öneminin farkına varılmalıdır. Üçüncü şahıslardan bu raporlama paketlerini satın almak daha mantıklı olacaktır, çünkü bu paketler KKP sisteminin geliştirilmesi gereken onlarca arayüzünden daha kolay ve verimli bir şekilde arayüz imkânı sağlayacaktır.
Günümüzde ayrıca internet tabanlı KKP sistemleri mevcuttur. Bazı işletmeler, herhangi bir yazılım yüklemeye gerek duymadan, birbirinden farklı birçok yazılımı, merkezden kullanabildiği için, internet tabanlı KKP sistemlerini kullanmaktadır. Internet bağlantısı olduğu sürece ya da LAN üzerinde bir ağ bağlantısı olduğu sürece, isteyen kişi klasik bir internet tarayıcısını kullanarak, internet tabanlı bir KKP sistemine girip, işlem yapabilir.
Bilgisayar güvenliği, KKP sistemlerinin olmazsa olmazlarındandır. Güvenlik sistemi, işletmeyi hem sanayi casusluğu gibi dışarıdan gelecek hem de zimmete geçirme gibi içeriden gelecek tehlikelere karşı korumalıdır. Başka bir senaryo da ise, bir terörist bir gıda şirketinin, malzeme listesinin içine bir zehir ekleyebilir ya da bir başka sabotaj faaliyetinde bulunabilir. KKP güvenliği bu tür suistimalleri de engellemeye yardımcı olur.
Artıları[değiştir | kaynağı değiştir]KKP sistemlerinin yokluğunda, büyük üreticiler kendilerini, birbiri ile etkileşimi ve bağlantısı olmayan birçok yazılım uygulamasının içerisinde bulabilirdi.
Birbiriyle etkileşimi olması gereken konulardan bazıları şunlardır:
Tasarım mühendisliği (nasıl daha iyi ürün yapılabilir)Mevcut potansiyelden, en iyi potansiyele kadar sipariş analiziFaturalardan, nakit makbuzlarına kadar gelir döngüsü oluşturulmasıSatınalma, envanter yönetimi, maliyetleme arasında sistem oluşturulmasıGelir, maliyet, kar konularında çeşitli seviyelerde muhasebe işlemlerinin yapılmasıKKP sistemleri sayesinde yukarıdaki gibi değişik konular, tek bir sistem altında toplanabilmektedir.
""Müşteri ilişkileri yönetimi"" gibi müşterilerle birebir ilişkili kavramlar, ""kalite kontrol"" gibi arka planda çalışan ve müşteri ihtiyaçlarının karşılanmasına odaklı kavramlar ve tedarikçilerle, taşıma işlemleri ile ilgilenen ""tedarik zinciri"" ile ilgili kavramlar, bazı sistemlerde kapsam ve etkinlik boşlukları olmasına rağmen, KKP sistemleri bünyesinde rahatça birleştirilebilir. Bir KKP sistemi olmadan, üretici için bu kavramları bir araya getirmek oldukça karmaşık ve zor olabilir.
KKP sistemlerinin kusursuz en önemli artılarından biri modüler yapı da olmasıdır. Modüler yapının önemi, KKP uygulamasını satın alma ve kurma sürecinde daha da ön plana çıkar. Bir kurum, KKP uygulamasının sahip olduğu fonksiyonların tümünü kullanmak istemeyebilir. Bu nedenle modüler yapı istenilen fonksiyonları istenilen zamanlarda kullanmayı mümkün kılar. Farklı uygulamalar her zaman birbiri ile uyumlu çalışmaz ve işletme için sorunlar oluşturulabilir. KKP sistemlerinde ise tüm modüller ve uygulamalar birbiri ile uyumlu olarak çalışmaktadır.
Komple bir çözüm sahibi olmanın, parça parça uygulamalara göre birçok önemli avantajı söz konusudur.
Ölçeklenebilirlik: KKP çözümleri, kurumun büyümesine paralel olarak genişleyebilme özelliğine sahiptir.Fonksiyonalite: KKP çözümleri, uygun maliyetlerle farklı fonksiyonlara gerektiği zaman erişmeyi mümkün kılar. Bugün ihtiyaç duymadığınız bir özelliği yarın aktive ederek kullanmanız mümkün.Destek ve hizmet: KKP çözümlerinde destek ve hizmet son derece önemlidir. Entegre bir KKP ortamının destek ve hizmet işlemleri çok daha basit ve etkili biçimde gerçekleştirilebilir.Eksileri[değiştir | kaynağı değiştir]İşletmelerin KKP sistemlerinde karşılaştıkları birçok sorun, işletmenin tüm çalışanları ilgilendiren ve sürekli yapılması gereken eğitim-gelişim çalışmalarının yetersiz seviyede olmasından kaynaklanmaktadır. Bu sorunlar, uygulama ve test çalışmalarında sorunlar oluşturmasının yanı sıra, KKP sistemindeki verilerin bütünlüğünü koruyan ve nasıl kullanılması gerektiğini belirleyen, şirket prensipleri ve kurarlarının bütünlüğünü de etkiler.
Değişik sistemlere göre farklılıklar içerse de, KKP sistemlerindeki bazı sınırlamaları şöyle sayabiliriz;
Başarı işgücünün niteliği ve tecrübesine bağlıdır. Buna sistemin doğru bir şekilde nasıl çalışabileceği üzerine verilen eğitimde dahildir. Birçok işletme maliyetlerini düşürmek için eğitim bütçelerinde kısıntılar yapmaktadır. Küçük özel işletmelerde genellikle KKP sistemleri, konu ile ilgili yeterli bilgisi olmayan kişiler tarafından kullanılmaktadır.Şirketler, kullanılan KKP sistemi ile ilgili yeterli eğitimi olmayan yeni bir yönetici işe alabilir. İşe alınan çalışan iş konusu ile mevcut KKP sistemi arasında bütünlük sağlayamayabilir.Bir KKP sistemini mevcut şirkete göre kişiselleştirme imkânı sınırlıdır. Bazı sistemlerdeki kişiselleştirmeler, KKP sisteminin yapısını değiştirebilir, ancak çoğu sistem genelde buna izin vermez.KKP sistemi tarafından önerilen, sanayi standartındaki bir yeniden mühendislik işlemi, şirketin rekabet gücü avantajının kaybına yol açabilir.KKP sistemi oluşturmak çok pahalı olabilir.KKP sistemleri genellikle özel iş akışları ve iş alanlarına adapte edilmesi zor sistemleridir, bu da şirketlerin çeşitli kayıplarının ana kaynağıdır.Sistemlerin kullanımı zordur.[kaynak belirtilmeli]Sistemi verimsiz ya da iyi kullanamayan bir departman ya da kullanıcı, diğer departmanları veya kullanıcıları da olumsuz şekilde etkileyebilir.İşletme sınırlarındaki belirsizlik, muhasabe işlemleri, güvenilirlik ve çalışan morali gibi konularda sorunlara yolaçabilir.Departmanlar arasındaki hassas iç bilgilerin paylaşılması zorluğu nedeniyle, yazılımın verimliliği azalabilir.Departmanlarda çeşitli eski sistemlerin yarattığı uyum sorunları sıklıkla ortaya çıkmaktadır.Pazar Payları[1][değiştir | kaynağı değiştir]Dünya Pazar Payları[değiştir | kaynağı değiştir]Epicor, Infor, Intacct Corporation,Microsoft Dynamics AX,Netsuite Inc.,Oracle,QAD,Ramco System,SAP AG,Salesfoece.com gibi büyük Global firmaların ürünleri ve satış oranları incelendiğinde Bulut ERP[2] pazarı ( Cloud ERP [3]) 2016-2021 arasında %8,3 büyüyecek. 2011 - 2015 arası için yapılan araştırmada ise büyüme oranı %6,38 olarak belirlenmiştir.Uluslararası araştırma şirketi Gartner17 Ağustos 2019 tarihinde Wayback Machine sitesinde arşivlendi.’in verilerine göre 2005 yılında dünya çapında ERP pazarının hacmi 16.7 milyar $ dır.Dünyada 2004-2005 yılları arasında ERP pazarı %5.4 olarak büyümüştür.Gartner verilerine göre global ERP pazarında 2005 yılı itibarı ile ilk 10 firma ve pazar payları;1.SAP			    28.21%

சொல்லின் தோற்றம்[தொகு]தொடக்கத்தில் ஒரு எம்ஆர்பி (MRP) பொருள் தேவைகளின் திட்டமிடல் மற்றும் சிஐஎம்மின் (CIM) விரிவாக்கமாக ஆரம்பிக்கப்பட்டது. இது கார்ட்னர் (Gartner) ஆராய்ச்சி மற்றும் ஆய்வகமாக 1990 ஆம் ஆண்டு அறிமுகப்படுத்தப்பட்டது. ஈஆர்பி வடிவமைப்புத் தொழிலின் கொள்கை அல்லது கோட்பாடு குறிப்பிட்ட துறை அல்லாது இப்போது ஒரு நிறுவனத்தின் அனைத்து மிக முக்கிய செயல்பாடுகளிலும் ஆதிக்கம் செலுத்துகிறது. இந்த அமைப்புகளை தயாரிப்புகள் அல்லாத, லாப நோக்கு இல்லாத மற்றும் அரசாங்க அமைப்புகளில் இப்போது காண்கிறோம். 

இந்த ஈஆர்பி அமைப்பை கருத்தில் கொள்ள, ஒரு மென்பொருளில் கண்டிப்பாக குறைந்தது இரண்டு அமைப்புகள் செயல்பட வேண்டும். உதாரணத்திற்கு, ஒரு மென்பொருள் பொட்டலத்தில் சம்பளப் பட்டியல் மற்றும் கணக்கு செயல்பாடுகள் இரண்டும் இணைக்கப்பட்டது ஒரு தொழில் நுட்பம் வாய்ந்த ஈஆர்பி மென்பொருளாக கருதப்படுகிறது. 

முன்னதாக இருந்த ஈஆர்பி உள்ளடக்கிய தனிப்பட்ட பொருத்தமான உதாரணங்கள் பின்வருமாறு: பொருளின் காலநிர்ணயத்தை நிர்வகித்தல், தொடர் சங்கிலி மேலாண்மை (உதாரணமாக வாங்குதல், தயாரித்தல் மற்றும் விநியோகம் போன்றவை), பண்டசாலை நிர்வகித்தல், வாடிக்கையாளர் தொடர்பு மேலாண்மை(CRM), விற்பனையை நடைமுறைப்படுத்துதல், இணையதள விற்பனை, நிதி நிர்வாகம், மனித வளம், மற்றும் முடிவெடுக்கும் ஆதரவு அமைப்பு போன்றவை ஆகும். 
ஈஆர்பி தீர்வுகளில் மேற்பார்வை[தொகு]சில நிறுவனங்களில் - போதுமான உள்ளமைப்புடன் தகவல் தொழில்நுட்பத் திறனை ஒருங்கிணைக்கும் பல தரப்பட்ட மென்பொருள் தயாரிப்பாளர்கள் - ஒரு பகுதி ஈஆர்பியை மட்டும் நிறைவேற்ற தேர்ந்தெடுத்து மற்றபடி அவர்களின் தேவைக்கேற்றபடி வெளி ஈஆர்பி செய்து அல்லது தனிப்பட்ட வடிவமைப்பை விரிவு செய்து கொள்கிறார்கள். உதாரணமாக, ஒருவர் மனித வளம் மேலாண்மை அமைப்பை வாங்கி அதை வைத்து தனக்குத் தேவையான இடைப்பட்ட வடிவமைப்பை அவர்களே பூர்த்தி செய்து கொள்ளலாம். 

சாதாரணமாக வியாபாரிகளிடையே[மேற்கோள் தேவை] இம்முறை பொதுவாக உள்ளது. இது நடுத்தர வியாபாரிகளிடமும் முரண்படும்போது விற்பனை செய்யும் இட(POS)த்தில் தயாரிப்பு மற்றும் நிதிநிலை பயன்பாடுகளைக் கையாள, பண்டசாலை நிர்வகித்தல், வருகைப் பதிவேடு, வியாபார ஈடுபாடு மற்றும் லாஜிஸ்டிக்ஸ் ஆகியவற்றிற்கு பிரத்யேகமான அலுவல் முறை தேவைப்படுகிறது. 

ஈஆர்பி பல மென்பொருள் தரவுகள் அடங்கிய ஒரே தரவு அடிப்படையை தருகிறது, அதில் அடங்குவன: 
தயாரித்தல்இயந்திரக்கலை, பொருளடக்கப் பட்டியல், கால நிர்ணயம், கொள்திறன், வேலை இயங்கும் நிலைப்பாடு, அடக்க விலை, தயாரிப்பு முறை, செயல்முறை தயாரிப்பு மற்றும் தயாரிப்பு இயங்குதல்தொடர் சங்கிலி மேலாண்மைரொக்க ஆணை, சரக்குப் பட்டியல், ஆணை குறித்தல், வடிவமைக்கப்பட்ட தயாரிப்புகள், தொடர் சங்கிலி திட்டமிடல், வழங்குபவர்கள் காலம் நிர்ணயித்தல், சரக்குகள் ஆய்வு, உரிமைகள் நடைமுறை மற்றும் தரகு கணக்கீடுநிதி நிர்வாகம்பொது கணக்குப் புத்தகம், ரொக்க நிர்வகிப்பு, செலவு கணக்கீடு, வரவு கணக்கீடு, அசையா சொத்துக்கள்செயல் முறை நிர்வாகம்விலையடக்கம், விலையிடுதல், நேரம் மற்றும் செலவினங்கள், செயல்திறன் அளவீடு மற்றும் நடவடிக்கைகள்மனித வளம்மனித வளம், சம்பளப் பட்டியல், பயிற்சி, நேரம் மற்றும் வருகைப் பதிவேடு, வேலை அட்டவணை, சலுகைகள்வடிக்கையாளர் தொடர்புவிற்பனை மற்றும் விளம்பரப்படுத்துதல், தரகுகள், சேவைகள், வடிக்கையளர் தொடர்பு, அழைப்பு நிலைய உதவிதரவு பண்டசாலை மற்றும் பல சுய உதவி வாடிக்கையளர், வழங்குபவர்கள் மற்றும் தொழிலாளர்கள் இணைப்புகள் ஆகியவற்றுடன் சேர்ந்தது கையாளும் அதிகாரம் செயலை முடிக்கத் தேவையான உபயோகிப்பாளர் நிலைக்கு ஏற்ற உரிமை தனிப்பயனாக்குதல் - செயல்முறை விரிவாக்கம், கூடுதல் மற்றும் மாறுதல்களை சரி செய்தல் 

நிறுவன வளம் திட்டமிடல் என்கிற சொற்றொடர் தயாரித்தல், வளம் திட்டமிடல் (எம்ஆர்பி II) பின்னர் பொருள் தேவைகளின் திட்டமிடல் (MRP) ஆகியவற்றை மூலமாகப் பெற்றது. மென்பொருள் கட்டமைப்பு நிர்வாகத்தின் பெரும்பகுதியை வரிசைபடுத்தி கொள்திறன் திட்டமிடல் போன்ற செயல்களும் மென்பொருள் செயல் திட்டமாக மாறியதனால் [8]எம்ஆர்பியின் மறு தோற்றமாக ஈஆர்பி உருவானது. [9]ஈஆர்பி அமைப்பு ஒரு நிறுவனத்தின் தயாரித்தல், லாஜிஸ்டிக்ஸ், விநியோகம், சரக்குப் பட்டியல், அனுப்புதல், விலை விவரங்கள், மற்றும் கணக்கிடுதல் போன்றவற்றை பொருத்தமாக கையாளுகிறது. மென்பொருள்தொழில் முறையில் விற்பனை, விளம்பரப்படுத்தல், அனுப்பி வைத்தல், விலையிடுதல், தயாரித்தல், சரக்குப் பட்டியலை நிர்வகித்தல், தர நிர்ணயம் மற்றும் மனிதவள மேலாண்மை ஆகிய செயற்பாடுகளை உள்ளடக்க ஈஆர்பி உதவுகிறது. 

21ஆம் நூற்றாண்டின் துவக்கத்தில் சந்தித்த ஒய்2கெ [Y2K] என்ற சட்ட சிக்கலை சரி செய்ய 1990 –ஆம் ஆண்டுகளில் ஈஆர்பி அமைப்பு பெரிய அளவில் விற்பனை செய்யப்பட்டது. பல நிறுவனகள் இந்தச் சந்தர்ப்பத்தில் சட்ட திட்டங்களுக்கு ஏற்றபடி ஈஆர்பி அமைப்புக்கு மாறின. ஒய்2கெ [Y2K] சிக்கலை சமாளிக்க பல நிறுவனங்கள் ஏற்கெனவே நடைமுறைப்படுத்தி விட்டதால், அதிவேக வளர்ச்சி கண்ட ஈஆர்பி 1999-ஆம் ஆண்டு சரிவு கண்டது. [2]
வாடிக்கையாளர்களும் பொது மக்களுக்கும் நேரடியான தொடர்பு இல்லாததால் ஈஆர்பி ஒரு பின்புற அலுவல் அமைப்புகள் என தவறாக எப்போதும் சொல்லப்பட்டது. நேரடியாக வாடிக்கையாளருடன் தொடர்பை நிர்வகிக்கும் வாடிக்கையாளர் தொடர்பு மேலாண்மைமுன்புற அலுவல் அமைப்பு (CRM) அல்லது ஈ-வணிகம், ஈ-அரசாங்கம், ஈ-தொலைத்தொடர்பு, ஈ-நிதி மற்றும் வழங்குபவர்கள் தொடர்பு மேலாண்மை (SRM) போன்ற மென்பொருளிலிருந்து இது மாறுபட்டு காணப்படுகிறது. 

அகன்ற தொழில் முனைப்பும் உள்கட்ட செயல்பாடுகளையும் ஈஆர்பி கொண்டுள்ளது. செயற்பாட்டிற்கும் தயாரிப்பிற்கும் ஒருங்கிணைந்த அனைத்து வித செயல் பிரிவுகளையும் உள்ளடக்கிய ஒரு அமைப்பு இதுவாகும். தயாரித்தல், பண்டசாலை, லாஜிஸ்டிக்ஸ், மற்றும் தகவல் தொழில்நுட்பம் மட்டுமின்றி கூடுதலாக கணக்கிடுதல், மனித வளம், விளம்பரப்படுத்தல் மற்றும் எதிர் கொள்ளும் மேலாண்மை போன்றவற்றை இது உள்ளடக்கியுள்ளது. 

ஈஆர்பி 2 என்பது வெளிப்படையான ஈஆர்பி பகுதிகளின் கட்டமைப்பை உள்ளடக்கியது. பழைய அமைப்பு ஈஆர்பி பகுதியின் ஒரே ஒருங்கிணைப்பை உள்ளடக்கியது.[12] 

ஈஏஎஸ் - நிறுவனப் பயன்பாட்டு தொகுதியின் புதிய பெயர் கொண்ட முன்னதாக வெளியிடப்பட்ட ஈஆர்பி அமைப்பு, தொழிலின் அனைத்து பகுதிகளையும் உள்ளடக்கிய, சாதாரண இணையதள உபயோகத்தில் சிறியதாக இருந்தது.[13] 

ஈஆர்பி வழங்கும் மென்பொருட்களில் சிறந்த செய்முறைகள் பெரும்பாலும் இணைக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது. ஈஆர்பி வடிவமைப்பை தீர்மானிக்கும் பொது நிறுவனங்கள் தேவைக்கு உரிய மென்பொருளையோ அல்லது அவர்களது தேவைக்கேற்ப மாற்றி அமைத்துக் கொள்ளவோ சிறப்பான செய்முறைகளை வெளிப்படுத்தக் கூடிய மென்பொருள் அடங்கிய ஒரு பொட்டலத்தை தேர்ந்தெடுக்கலாம். 

ஈஆர்பி முறைக்கு முன்னர் இருந்த மென்பொருள் அனைத்தும் தனிப்பட்ட செயல்முறை அலுவல்கள் அமைப்பிற்கு பொருந்தின. கடும் சிக்கலான அமைப்பு கொண்ட அநேக ஈஆர்பி மற்றும் மாறான விளைவுகளினால் புறக்கணிக்கப்பட்ட ஈஆர்பி முறையை சரி செய்து ""சிறப்பான செய்முறைகள்"" கொண்டதாக வழங்கப்பட்டது. நிறுவனம் முழமையான பலன் பெரும் அடிப்படையுடன் இந்தச் சிறந்த செய்முறைகளுடன் கூடிய ஒரு அலுவல் செய்ய தகுதி வாய்ந்த ஒன்றை நிறைவேற்றுவது வழியென வழங்குபவர்கள் கருதினார்கள். லுக்விக்ஷபின் பிரயோக அறிவியல் பல்கலைக்கழகம் [14] நுண்ணாய்வு நடத்திய 192 நிறுவனங்களில் மேற்கொண்ட சிறந்த செய்முறைகளின் மூலம் தொழிற்சாலைகளின் செயல் வடிவம், ஆவணங்கள், சோதனைகள் மற்றும் பயிற்சிகள் அனைத்தும் குறிக்கோள் அடிப்படையிலான செயல் முறைகளில் சுமையை குறைத்துள்ளது என்ற முடிவை அறிந்துகொள்ள முடிந்தது. மேலும், இந்தச் சிறந்த செயல்முறைகள் 71 சதவிகித அபாய நிலையை மற்ற மென்பொருட்கள் நடைமுறைப்படுத்தியதைக் காட்டிலும் குறைத்தன. [3]
சிறந்த செயல்முறைகளின் உபயோகம் என்பது [[ஐஎப்ஆர்எஸ் [IFRS] |ஐஎப்ஆர்எஸ்]], சர்பேன்ஸ்-ஆக்ஸ்லி அல்லது பாசெல்-II (IFRS, Sarbanes-Oxley or Basel II) போன்ற குறிப்பிட்ட தேவைகளுக்கு உடன்பட்டு சுலபமாக அமைகிறது. மின்னணு பணப் பரிமாற்றம் என்பது வாணிப செயல்பாட்டு முறைகளிலும் உதவியாக இருக்கிறது. முறையாக வகைப்படுத்துதல் மற்றும் அதிகாரப்பூர்வ அறிக்கை அல்லது சரக்குகளை குறியீடு செய்தல் ஈஆர்பி மென்பொருளில் தயாராக இருப்பதனால், பல அலுவல்களின் தேவை ஒரே மாதிரியாக இருக்கும் பட்சத்தில் ஈஆர்பியை உறுதியுடன் மறுபதிவு செய்ய முடிகிறது.[16] 
செயல்படுத்துதல்[தொகு]அலுவலகங்களுக்கான அகன்ற நோக்க செயல்களும் செயல்முறைகளும் நடைமுறைப்படுத்தப்பட்டன. எடுத்துக்காட்டாக பணியாளர் வேலை முறையில் வழக்கமாக முக்கிய மாறுதல்களை புகுத்த வல்ல ஈஆர்பி மென்பொருள் அமைப்பை தயாரிப்பது என்பது சிக்கலான ஒன்று. [4]எடுத்துகாட்டாக ஈஆர்பி மென்பொருளை உள் பணியாளர்களை வைத்து நடைமுறைப்படுத்துவது மிகவும் சிக்கலானதால், அதற்கென தொழில்முறை பயிற்சி பெற்ற வெளி ஆலோசகர்களை வாடகை முறையில் அமர்த்தி இந்த அமைப்பை நடைமுறைப்படுத்துவது விரும்பத்தக்கது. இது ஒரு செலவினங்கள் குறைந்த முறையுமாகும். ஆலோசனை, தனிப்பயனாக்குதல் மற்றும் ஆதரவு-ஆகிய மூன்றிற்கும் வெளிப்புறச் சேவையை பயன்படுத்திக் கொள்ளலாம். [18]ஈஆர்பி அமைப்பு நடைமுறைப்படுத்த எடுத்துக் கொள்ளும் காலம் அலுவல்களின் அளவு, கூறுகளின் எண்ணிக்கை, விரிவான தனிப்பயனாக்குதல், மாற்றங்களுக்கான நோக்கம் மற்றும் தன் திட்டத்தை உரிமையாக்கிக் கொள்ள விரும்பும் வாடிக்கையாளர் ஆகியவற்றைப் பொறுத்தது. ஈஆர்பி அமைப்பு கூறுகளைக் கொண்டதால் எல்லாவற்றையும் ஒரே சமயத்தில் நடைமுறைப்படுத்த தேவையில்லை என்பதுடன், அவற்றை பல பாகங்களாகப் பிரிக்கலாம். ஒரு திட்டத்தை முடிக்க 14 மாதங்களு  ஆலோசகர்கள் தேவைப்படுகின்றனர். [19] ஒரு சிறிய திட்டத்திற்கு (உதாரணமாக, 100 பணியாளர்களைக் கொண்ட நிறுவனத்திற்கு) வடிவம் கொடுத்து அதைச் செயல்படுத்த மூன்றிலிருந்து ஒன்பது மாதங்கள் வரை ஆகலாம். எப்படியும் பெரிய, பல இடங்கள், பல தேசங்கள் சம்மந்தப்பட்ட ஒன்றை நடைமுறைப்படுத்த வருடக் கணக்கில் ஆகும். [20] தனிப்பயனாக்குதல் தேவையைப் பொறுத்து நடைமுறைப்படுத்தும் காலம் வெகுவாக மாறுபடுகிறது. [5]
ஈஆர்பி அமைப்புகளை நடைமுறைப்படுத்த நிறுவனங்கள் அடிக்கடி ஒரு ஈஆர்பி வழங்குபவரையோ பிற ஆலோசனை வழங்கும் நிறுவனங்களையோ உதவிக்கு அழைக்கிறார்கள். இந்த நிறுவனங்கள் தொழில்ரீதியான சேவைகளை ஆலோசனை, தனிப்பயனாக்குதல் மற்றும் ஆதாரம் ஆகிய மூன்று துறைகளில் சிறப்பாக வழங்குகிறார்கள். இத்திட்டத்தை நடைமுறைப்படுத்தும் சமயத்தில் இந்த நிறுவனங்கள் செயல் திட்ட மேலாண்மை, அலுவல்களை ஆய்வு செய்தல், மாற்று மேலாண்மை மற்றும் யுஏடி (UAT)  ஆகியவற்றில் தேர்ச்சி பெற்றவர்களைக் கொண்டு அலுவல் தேவைகளைத் தொடர்ந்து மேற்கொள்ளும்படி ஏற்பாடு செய்கிறது. 

ஈஆர்பி நடைமுறைப்படுத்திய வெற்றியை தீர்மானிப்பதில் தரவு இடமாற்றம் முக்கிய பங்கு வகிக்கிறது. தரவு இடமாற்றத்திற்கு முன்னர் அதிக முடிவுகள் கட்டாயம் எடுத்தாக வேண்டிய நிலையில் குறிப்பிடத்தக்க திட்டமிடல் மேற்கொள்ளப்பட வேண்டும். ஈஆர்பியை நடைமுறைப்படுத்துவதில் உற்பத்தி பகுதியின் தரவு இடமாற்றம் முக்கியமற்றதாகக் கருதப்படுவது துரதிர்ஷ்டவசமானதாகும். பின்வரும் படிகள் தரவு இடமாற்ற உபாயம் ஈஆர்பியை வெற்றிகரமாக நடைமுறைப்படுத்த உதவும்.[23] 
தரவு இடமாற்றம் செய்ய வேண்டியவைகளை அடையாளங்காணுதல்தரவு இடமாற்றம் செய்யப்பட நேரத்தை தீர்மானித்தல்தரவு படிமங்களை உருவாக்குதல்தரவு இடமாற்றக் கருவிகளை முடக்குதல்இடமாற்றம் சம்பந்தமான நிறுவல்களை தீர்மானித்தல்தரவு காப்பாக இருக்க முடிவெடுத்தல்செயல்முறை[தொகு]ஈஆர்பி வழங்குபவர்கள் அனைத்து வகையிலும் தரமான அலுவல் முறைகளை, சிறந்த அலுவல் செயல் முறைகளின் அடிப்படையில் வடிவமைப்பு செய்துள்ளார்கள். வழங்குபவர்கள் பலராக இருந்தாலும், பல வகைகளில் இருந்தாலும் செயல் முறைகள் அனைத்தும் ஒரே தரமானதாக, இயல்பான கூற்றுடன் இருக்கும். தரமான செயல்முறைக்கு ஏற்ப நடைமுறையில் ஈஆர்பியை மாற்ற நிர்பந்தித்ததன் விளைவாக ஏற்கெனவே நிறுவனங்களில் இருந்த செயல்முறையில் பல முரண்பாடுகள் ஏற்பட்டன. [24] அலுவல் செயல்முறைகள் ஈஆர்பியை நடைமுறைப்படுத்த ஆரம்பிக்கும் முன்னர், நிகழ்கால முறை புறக்கணிக்கப்படுவது தோல்வியுற்ற ஈஆர்பி முறைக்கான முக்கிய காரணமாக இருக்கிறது. [25]அதனால் நிறுவனங்களில் அலுவல்களை முற்றிலும் செய்து முடிப்பது ஈஆர்பி வழங்குபவர்களை தேர்ந்தெடுத்து நடைமுறைப்படுத்தும் முன்னர் அவசியமாகிறது. இந்த ஆய்வில் அனைத்து விதமான தற்கால இயங்கும் செயல்முறைகளை விரிவாக்கம் செய்வதனால் ஒரு ஈஆர்பி வழங்குபவரின் தரமான கூற்றுகள் நன்கு நிறுவப்பட்ட நிறுவனங்களுக்கு ஏற்றவாறு அமைகிறது. பின்னர் ஈஆர்பியை மறுவடிவாக்கம் செய்து செயல்முறையோடு ஒன்றிப்போகுமாறு செய்யலாம். ஆராய்ச்சிகள் உணர்த்தும் முரண்பட்ட அலுவல்களின் செயல்முறை இடர்களை குறைக்க: 
ஒவ்வொரு நிறுவனத்தின் செயல்முறைகளை அந்நிறுவனத்தின் நடவடிக்கையுடன் இணைப்பது;ஒவ்வொரு செயல்முறையையும் தற்போதைய அலுவலுடன் தொடர்புடைய செயல் வல்லமையின் பலன்களை ஆய்வு செய்வது;தற்போதைக்கு நடைமுறைப்படுத்தப்படும் தன்னியக்க சாரம்சத்தை புரிந்து கொள்வது. [6][7]கிட்டத்தட்ட தனித்து அலுவல்களை மேற்கொள்ளும் கட்டமைப்பு கொண்ட நிறுவனங்களில், ஒவ்வொருவரும் அவர்களின் லாப நஷ்டங்களுக்கு பொறுப்பாகிறார்கள், அத்துடன்  செயல்முறைகள், அலுவல் விதிகள், தரவு சார்ந்தவைகள், அதிகாரம் வழங்கும் தலைமைகள் மற்றும் முடிவு மையங்கள் ஆகியன ஈஆர்பி நடைமுறைப்படுத்துவதை கடினமாக்குகிறது. [29] சாராம்சங்கள் உள்ளடக்கிய தேவைகள் ஒத்துப்போக உள் வல்லுநர்களுடன் கலந்து பேசி மாற்று மேலாண்மை அல்லது தளர்ந்த நிகழ்வுகளை நடைமுறைப்படுத்தலாம் உதாரணமாக, முதன்மைத் தரவு மேலாண்மையை முறையாக இணைப்பது பிரத்யேகமாக உருவாக்குதல் மற்றும் / அல்லது அவசியத்திற்கு உட்பட்ட தனிப்பயனை பூர்த்தி செய்வது. 

அலுவல்கள் நடைமுறையில் தரமான ஈஆர்பி கூற்றுகளை மறுவடிவம் செய்வதால், ஈஆர்பி அனுகூலம் பெறாததற்கான காரணத்தை நம்மால் உணர்நதுகொள்ள முடிகிறது. இது மாதிரியான நேரீடுகளுக்கான படிவ ஆதாரம் இருந்தபோதிலும், செயல்முறை ஈஆர்பி அமைப்புகள் உண்மையில் தங்களுக்கான அனுகூலத்தை மேம்படுத்திக்கொண்டன. [8][9]வடிவமைப்பு (Configuration)[தொகு]ஈஆர்பியை வடிவமைப்பதன் சிறப்பம்சம் என்னவென்றால் நாம் எப்படி அந்த அமைப்பு வேலை செய்யும் என்று நினைக்கிறோமோ அதே போல அந்த அமைப்பு நம்மை வேலை செய்ய அனுமதிக்கும். நிறுவ வேண்டிய கூற்றை தேர்ந்தெடுத்து, பின்னர் வரையறுக்கப்பட்ட அட்டவணைகளை உபயோகித்து நிறுவனங்களின் செயல்முறைக்கு ஏற்ற சிறந்த வேலையமைப்பை பொருத்தமாக செய்து முடிக்கலாம். 

கூறுகள் — அமைப்புகள் கூறுகளைக் கொண்டது, சில இயக்கங்களை நடைமுறைப்படுத்தும் போது இது சாதரணமாக இருக்கிறது. ஆனால் மற்றவைகளில் கூறுகள் இல்லை. நிதி மற்றும் கணக்கு போன்ற சில பொதுவான கூறுகள் அனைத்தும் நிறுவன அமைப்பை நடைமுறைப்படுத்த விழைகின்றன; அவசியம் இல்லாததாக காரணம் கூறி மனித வள மேலாண்மை போன்ற கூறுகளை சில நிறுவனங்கள் தவிர்த்துவிட்டன. உதாரணத்திற்கு ஒரு சேவை செய்யும் நிறுவனத்திற்கு தயாரிப்புகளுக்கான கூறு நிச்சயம் தேவைப்படாது. அதே சமயம் சில நிறுவனங்கள் கூறுகளை மாற்றம் செய்வதில்லை. பொதுவாக பேசும்போது அதிக எண்ணிக்கையில் கூறுகளை தேர்ந்தெடுத்தால் அதிக அளவிலான முழு நன்மைகளும் கிடைக்கும் ஆனால் அதிகமான விலைகள், அபாயங்கள் மற்றும் மாற்றங்களும் ஏற்படும். 

வடிவமைப்பு அட்டவணைகள் – வடிவமைப்பு அட்டவணை ஒரு நிறுவனத்தின் அலுவல்களுக்கு ஏற்ப குறிப்பான நோக்குடன் பொருத்தமான அமைப்புகளை உள்ளடக்கியிருப்பதால் தேவைக்கேற்ப அதனைத் தேர்ந்தெடுக்க முடியும். உதாரணமாக, நிறுவனங்கள் – [[எப்ஐஎப்ஒ [FIFO] மற்றும் எல்ஐஎப்ஒ [LIFO] கணக்கு |எப்ஐஎப்ஓ (FIFO) அல்லது எல்ஐஎப்ஓ (LIFO)]] – கையாளும் விதம் அல்லது பூகோள அடிப்படை, தயாரிப்பு அடிப்படை அல்லது விநியோக அடிப்படை போன்றவைகளில் வருமான அங்கீகரிப்பைப் பொருத்து சரக்குகளின் பட்டியல் கணக்கு தேர்வு செய்யப்படும். 

அப்படி அமைப்பிற்குள் அனுமதி செய்யப்பட விருப்பங்கள் தேவையை பூர்த்தி செய்யாவிட்டால் என்ன நடக்கும்? இந்தச் சமயத்தில் நிறுவனத்திற்கு இரண்டு வழிகள் உள்ளன, ஆனால் அவை  இரண்டுமே அர்த்தமற்றது. நிறுவன அமைப்பின் குறியீடுகளை மாற்றி எழுதலாம், அல்லது இருக்கும் அமைப்பைத் தொடர்ந்து உபயோகித்துப் புதிய நிறுவன அமைப்பை உருவாக்கி இணைத்துக் கொள்ளலாம். இரண்டு விருப்பங்களும் செயல்முறைப்படுத்தும் போது கூடுதல் நேரம் தேவைப்படுகிறது. மேலும் கூடுதலாக அமைப்பின் ஒருங்கிணைப்பு நன்மைகளை குறைவடையச் செய்கிறது. அமைப்பை அதிகமாக தனிப்பயனாக்கினால் வழங்குபவர்களுக்கும் வாடிக்கையாளர்களுக்கும் இடையிலான தெரிவிக்கும் இணைப்பு குறைந்து விடுகிறது. 
ஆலோசனை சேவைகள்[தொகு]அநேக நிறுவனங்கள் ஈஆர்பி திட்டத்தை நடைமுறைப்படுத்த போதுமான உட்புற செயல்திறனை கொண்டிருக்கவில்லை. இதன் பலனால் ஈஆர்பி நடைமுறைப்படுத்தும் ஆலோசனை சேவையை பல நிறுவனங்கள் கொடுக்க ஆரம்பித்தன. எடுத்துக்காட்டாக, ஒரு ஈஆர்பி ஆலோசனை குழுமத்தின் பொறுப்புகள் திட்டமிடல், பயிற்சி அளித்தல், பரிசோதனை, நடைமுறைப்படுத்துதல் மற்றும் தனிப்பயனளிக்கும் கூறுகளை கொடுப்பது என்ற அனைத்தையும் உள்ளடக்கி இருந்தன. கூடுதலான தயாரிப்பு பயிற்சியை அளித்தல், விரைவுபடுத்தும் செயல் முறையை தோற்றுவித்தல் மற்றும் அலுவல்களை நடைமுறைப்படுத்துதல், ஈஆர்பியை உபயோகித்து அலுவல்களை மேம்படுத்த பிரத்யேகமான அறிவுரைகளை அல்லது அமைப்பை உகந்ததாக்குதல் மற்றும் அறிக்கைகள் எழுதுவதில் உள்ள சிக்கலை தரவு வடித்தெடுத்தல் அல்லது நடைமுறைப்படுத்த அறிவுத்திறன் உள்ள அலுவலுக்கு துணையாக இருத்தல் போன்றவை தனிப்பயனாக்குதலின் உதாரணங்களாகும். 

இதை அநேக நடுத்தர நிறுவனங்களுக்கு நடைமுறைப்படுத்த ஆகும் செலவு ஈஆர்பி உபயோகிப்பாளர் உரிமத்தின் தோராய பட்டியல் விலையிலிருந்து (தனிப்பயனாக்குதல் தேவையைப் பொறுத்து) இருமடங்காக ஆகலாம். பெரிய நிறுவனங்கள் முக்கியமாக பல இடங்களிலும் பல நாடுகளிலும் இருக்கும் நிறுவனங்களில் இதை அடிக்கடி நடைமுறைப்படுத்துவதால் உரிமத்துக்கு ஆகும் செலவைவிட மூன்றிலிருந்து ஐந்து மடங்கு அதிகமாக செலவாகும். [மேற்கோள் தேவை]
வளர்ச்சி அடிப்படையிலான ஈஆர்பி பொட்டலக் குறியீடுகளை ஈஆர்பி வழங்குபவர்கள் அளிக்கிறார்கள். ஆரம்ப காலங்களில் ஈஆர்பி வழங்குபவர்கள் தங்களது சாராம்சங்களின் அடிப்படையில் ஈஆர்பியை உருவாக்கும்போது, உட்கட்ட செயல்பாடுகளுடன் நல்ல உத்திகளை ஒருங்கிணைத்து தீர்வு காணும் வகையில் உருவாக்கினர், இதனால் ஈஆர்பியின் விற்பனை குறிப்பிடும் அளவில் இருந்தது. 
ஈஆர்பி அமைப்பு, கருத்தளவில் துறையில் சிறந்த நடைமுறைகளை அடிப்படையாக கொண்டவை மற்றும் பரவலாக இருக்கும் என்று கருதப்படுகிறது.
""அமைப்பின் கரு"" தனிப்பயனாக்குதல் மற்றும் வடிவமைத்தல்[தொகு]ஈஆர்பி வழங்குபவர்கள் தனிப்பயனாக்குவதைக் குறைக்க முன்னேற்பாடான கட்டமைப்புடன் ""வடிவமைப்புக்"" கருவிகளைக் கொண்டு வாடிக்கையாளர்களின்' தேவைக்கு ஏற்ப அமைப்பின் கரு எப்படி செய்வது என்பதில் அதிக கவனம் செலுத்தினர். தனிப்பயனாக்குதல் மற்றும் வடிவமைத்தல் ஆகியவற்றிற்கு இடைப்பட்ட முக்கிய வித்தியாசங்கள் பின்வருவனவற்றை உள்ளடக்கியவை: 
தனிப்பயனாக்குதல் எப்போதும் விருப்பத்திற்கு உட்பட்டது, ஆனால் சில நிலைகளில் வடிவமைப்பு முதலிலேயே (உதாரணமாக நிர்மாணிக்க ஆகும் செலவு/லாபகரமான அமைப்புகள், நிறுவனத்தின் பாரம்பரியம், வாங்குதலுக்கான ஒப்புதல் விதிகள் ஆகியவை அடங்கும்) மென்பொருள் வேலை செய்ய அவசியமாக கருதப்படுகிறது.வடிவமைப்பு எல்லா வாடிக்கையாளர்களுக்கும் கிடைக்கும், ஆனால் தனிப்பயனாக்குதல் வடிக்கையளரின் தனிப்பட்ட உரிமைக்குட்பட்ட வியாபார-போட்டிக்கு இடமளிக்கும் செயல்முறைகளைப் பொறுத்தது.வடிவமைப்பில் செய்யும் மாறுதல்கள் வழங்கப்பட்ட தரவு அட்டவணைகளில் குறிப்பாக பதிவு செய்யப்படும், ஆனால் தனிப்பயனாக்குதல் வழக்கமாக அட்டவணை கட்டமைப்பில் சில மூல செயல்கள் மற்றும்/அல்லது மாறுதல்களை செய்யத் தேவைப்படுகிறது.வடிவமைப்பு மாற்றங்களின் விளைவாக அமைப்பின் செயல்திறனை தொடர்புபடுத்தி சொல்ல முடியும், இதன் பெரும் பொறுப்பு ஈஆர்பி வழங்குபவர்களைச் சார்ந்ததாகும். தனிப்பயனாக்குதலின் விளைவை குறிப்பிட்டுச் சொல்ல முடியாது மற்றும்  பரிசோதனை மேற்கொள்ள குழுமத்திற்கு கால அவகாசம் தேவைப்படலாம்.வடிவமைப்பு மாற்றங்கள் அனைத்திலும் மென்பொருள் மேம்படுத்தப்பட்டாலும், புதிய கூறுகள் நிலைத்து நிற்கும். சில தனிப்பயனாக்குதல் (உதாரணமாக உபயோகக் குறியீடுகள் முன்-வரையறுக்கப்பட்ட ""கொக்கிகள்"" முன்னரும்/பின்னரும் தரவு திரைகளில் தோன்றும்) மேம்படுத்தலில் நிலைக்கு  ஆனாலும் அவைகளை மறுபரிசீலனை செய்தாக வேண்டும். அதிக நீட்டித்த தனிப்பயனாக்குதல் (உதாரணமாக மாறுதல் செய்யப்பட அந்த அடிப்படையான தரவு கட்டுமானங்கள்) மேம்படுத்தலில் மறைந்து விடும் அபாயம் உள்ளது அதனால் அவற்றை மீண்டும் நடைமுறைப்படுத்த வேண்டும்.இந்த ஆய்வினால், தனிப்பயனாக்குதலில் ஒரு ஈஆர்பி பொட்டலம் எதிபாராத விதமாக விலை உயர்ந்தும் சிக்கலாகவும் இருக்க நேரிடும் போது, அமைப்பின் முழுமையான பலன்கள் கிடைப்பது தாமதமாகிறது. எப்படி இருந்தாலும், தனிப்பயனாக்குதலில் ஒரு ஈஆர்பி தொகுதியால் இரகசிய விருப்பத்தை குறிப்பிட்ட வகையில் மிகையாக்கி தொழிற்சாலையின் சிறந்த செயல் முறைகள் மூலம் குறைந்த உணர்திறன் பகுதியில் நோக்கங்களை நிறைவேற்ற முடிகிறது. 
விரிவாக்கம்[தொகு]இந்த இடத்தில் ""விரிவாக்கம்"" என்பது வழிமுறைகளுடன் ஒப்படைக்கப்பட்ட ஈஆர்பி நிலைகளை வெளியாட்கள்[third-party] உதவிகொண்டு விரிவுபடுத்திக் கொள்ளலாம். தொழில்நுட்ப முறையில் வெளியாட்கள் செயலுடன் அநேக ஈஆர்பி அமைப்பை செயற்படுத்துவது என்பது சுலபமே. 
காப்பகத்தில் பதியும் குறிப்புகள், எடுத்துரைத்தல் மற்றும் மறு வெளியீடுகள் (சுலபமாக முயன்று பெற முடியும், ஏனெனில் அவைகள் பெருமளவு நிலையான தரவு);செயற்படுத்தும் தரவு குறிப்புகளை கைப்பற்றுகிறது, உதாரணமாக ஊடுருவி, பணப்பெட்டிகள் அல்லது ஆர்எப்ஐடியை, உபயோகிப்பது சுலபமாகும் (ஏனெனில் அவைகள் இருக்கின்ற தரவை அளிப்பதாலே);....எப்படியானாலும் ஈஆர்பி செயலினிகளின் செயற்கையான விதிகளுடன் இருப்பதால் கட்டுப்பாட்டுடன் முதன்மைத் தரவை ஏற்படுத்தவோ அல்லது மாற்றவோ முடியும், சில குறிப்பீடுகள் மிகவும் நிறைவேற்ற கடினமானதாக இருக்கிறது.
பராமரித்தல் மற்றும் ஆதரவு சேவைகள்[தொகு]பராமரித்தல் மற்றும் ஆதரவு சேவைகள், இயக்கங்களில் உள்ள ஈஆர்பி அமைப்பை கண்காணிப்பதிலும், நிர்வகிப்பதிலும் ஈடுபடுகிறது. இந்த செயல்களை நிறுவனத்தினுள் தகவல்நுட்பப் பிரிவை சேர்ந்த பணியாளர்கள் செய்கிறார்கள் அல்லது வெளிப்புற ஆலோசனை மற்றும் சேவை நிறுவனங்களின் வல்லுநர்களைக் கொண்டும் நிர்வகிக்கப்படுகிறது. 
அனுகூலங்கள்[தொகு]ஒரு ஈஆர்பி அமைப்பைக் கொண்டிருக்காத சமயத்தில், பெரிய தயாரிப்பாளர்கள் பல்வேறு மென்பொருள் செயல்களின் அறிவிப்புகள் அல்லது இணைப்புகள் ஒன்றுகொன்று திறம்பட செயல்படாது போவதைக் காண்கிறார்கள். ஒன்றுக்கொன்று இணைந்து மேற்கொள்ளப்பட வேண்டிய வேலைகளின் உள்ளடக்கம் பின்வருமாறு: 
பல தரப்பட்ட செயல்பகுதிகளுக்கு இடையில் தக்க அறிவிப்பு, உற்பத்தி, திறனாற்றல் போன்றவற்றை முழுமையாக உறுதி செய்வதுவடிவமைப்பு இயந்திரக்கலை (சிறந்த முறையில் தயாரிப்பது எப்படி என்பதைத் தெளிவுபடுத்துதல்)ஆணை செயல்படும் தடம், ஒப்புகொண்டது முதல் நிறைவேற்றும் வரையிலுமான கால அளவுவருமான சுழற்சி, விலை விவரம் முதல் பணம் வரவு வரையிலும்பிணைந்துள்ள செயல் முறைகள் சிக்கலைச் சமாளிப்பதுமூன்று-வழி இடையேயான பொருந்தியானது செயல்படும் தடம் வாங்குதற்கான ஆணை(ஆணையிட்டது), சரக்குகளின் பட்டியலைப் பெறுதல் (வந்து சேர்ந்தது), மற்றும் அடக்கவிலை (வழங்குபவர்கள் விலை விவரம்) ஆகியவற்றை உள்ளடக்கியதுசெயல்படும் தடம் வருமானம், அடக்கம் மற்றும் லாபம் இவற்றிற்கு எல்லாமான சிறிய அளவிலான கணக்குஈஆர்பி அமைப்புகளின் தரவு ஒரு இடத்தில் மையமாக இருக்கிறது. இதன் உள்ளடக்கிய நன்மைகள் பின்வருமாறு:

การพัฒนารูปแบบของการดำเนินงานในโรงงาน
โดยจะมีการนำเอา e-Manufacturing เข้ามาใช้ในโรงงานนั้นจะช่วยในเรื่องของการผลิตสินค้าเพื่อเก็บไว้ในคงคลัง, จัดมาตรฐานของหน้าบ้าน และการจัดการบำรุงรักษาเครื่องจักร มีประสิทธิภาพขึ้น ดังนี้
การจัดเก็บสินค้าคงคลังให้ได้คุณภาพสูงการจัดการสินทรัพย์, การจัดหาวัตถุดิบ และการบำรุงรักษาการนำเอาอินเทอร์เน็ตมาใช้ในโรงงานอุตสาหกรรมอินเทอร์เน็ตนั้นได้เข้ามามีส่วนในการเปลี่ยนแปลงพฤติกรรมของผู้ซื้อสินค้า ผู้ซื้อสามารถสั่งซื้อของได้เพียงปลายนิ้วคลิก และยังสามารถเลือกรูปแบบตามความต้องการได้ นอกจากเป็นเครื่องมือในการซื้อและแหล่งข้อมูลที่สำคัญ แล้วนั้นยังทำให้ธุรกิจนั้นเคลื่อนไปอย่างรวดเร็วด้วย
สำหรับผู้ผลิตแล้วการที่มี e-Business อย่างเดียวนั้นคงจะไม่สามารถทำงานได้ดีหากปราศจากโซ่อุปทานที่เป็นมืออาชีพและสินค้าที่มีคุณภาพและมีชื่อเสียงระดับโลก เพื่อที่จะผลิตสินค้าให้เป็นที่พอใจของลูกค้า การที่มีสินค้าเพียงเก็บไว้ในคงคลังนั้นคงไม่พอแล้ว สำหรับตลาดที่มีการแข่งขันสูงในตอนนี้
กลยุทธ์ในการนำความขัดแย้งออกจากวิสาหกิจลักษณะของกลยุทธ์ทาง e-Manufacturing เป็นอย่างไร ลองดูเรื่องสั้นนี้ที่จะช่วยให้มีความเข้าใจมากขึ้น เรื่องนี้เป็นเรื่องราวของลิมิตสวิตช์ (Limit Switch) ซึ่งเป็นเพียงแค่สวิตช์ปิดเปิดธรรมดาที่มีแขนยื่นออกมา ตัวลิมิตสวิตช์ จะอยู่ติดบนสายพาน ในแต่ละครั้งที่วัตถุมาบนสายพาน มันจะผลักตัวแขนออกไปทางหนึ่งซึ่งหมายถึงสวิตช์กำลัง เปิด อยู่ และเมื่อกล่องผ่านไปตัวแทนก็จะตีกลับมาที่เดิม
ประวัติ[แก้]แนวคิด ERP เริ่มในยุคปี ค.ศ. 1990 ที่ประเทศสหรัฐอเมริกา จุดกำเนิดเริ่มแรกของ ERP มาจากแนวคิดของการพัฒนาระบบการบริหารการผลิตรวม (Material Requirement Resource Planning / Manufacturing Resource Planning, MRP System) ของอุตสาหกรรมการผลิตในอเมริกา โดยคำว่า ERP และแนวคิดของ ERP นั้นก็พัฒนามาจาก MRP ในที่นี้จะทำการอธิบาย ความเป็นมาของ MRP โดยย่อว่ามีความเป็นมาอย่างไร และทำไมจึงพัฒนามาเป็น ERP ได้ ซึ่งจะช่วยให้สามารถเข้าใจความหมายของ ERP ได้ดียิ่งขึ้น และตัวแนวคิด ERP เองก็ยังมีวิวัฒนาการอยู่ จาก ERP ก็จะเป็น Extended ERP และจะพัฒนาไปเป็น Next Generation ERP ต่อไปในอนาคต
แนวคิด MRP เกิดขึ้นครั้งแรกที่อเมริกาในยุคต้นของ ทศวรรษ 1960 ในช่วงแรก MRP ย่อมาจาก Material Requirement Planning (การวางแผนความต้องการวัสดุ) เป็นวิธีการในการหาชนิดและจำนวนวัสดุที่ต้องใช้ในการผลิตตามตารางเวลาและจำนวนสินค้าที่ได้วางแผนโดย MPS (Master Production Schedule) ย่างเข้ายุคปี ค.ศ. 1970 MRP ได้รับการพัฒนาให้มีความสามารถในการป้อนกลับข้อมูลการผลิตจริงใน shop floor นอกจากนั้นยังเพิ่มแนวคิดเรื่อง การวางแผนความต้องการกำลังการผลิต (capacity requirements planning)
จากความสำเร็จของ Closed Loop MRP ก็เกิดการพัฒนาต่อยอดขึ้นเป็น MRP II ในยุคปี ค.ศ. 1980 (โดย MRP ใหม่นี้ย่อมาจาก Manufacturing Resource Planning) ซึ่งได้รวมการวางแผนและบริหารทรัพยากรการผลิตอื่น ๆ นอกจากการวางแผนและควบคุมกำลังการผลิต และวัตถุดิบการผลิต เข้าไปในระบบด้วย MRP II เป็นแนวคิดที่ใช้ในอุตสาหกรรมการผลิต ERP ได้ขยายแนวคิดของ MRP II ให้สามารถใช้ได้ทั้งองค์กรของธุรกิจที่หลากหลาย โดยการรวมระบบงานหลักทุกอย่างในองค์กรเข้ามาเป็นระบบเดียวกัน
คำจำกัดความ[แก้]การวางแผนทรัพยากรองค์กร (ERP) เป็นการนำระบบงานทุกอย่างในองค์กรมาทำการเชื่อมโยงเข้าด้วยกันและมีการนำข้อมูลจากทุกแผนกงานต่าง ๆ นั้นนำมาใช้ร่วมกันเพื่อให้การดำเนินงานมีประสิทธิภาพมากขึ้น และมีผู้ที่ได้ให้ความหมายหรือคำนิยามเกี่ยวกับการวางแผนทรัพยากร องค์กรไว้ดังต่อไปนี้
การวางแผนทรัพยากรองค์กร (ERP) โดยการมุ่งเน้นที่จะปรับปรุงระบบการดำเนินงานและการพัฒนาบุคลากรขององค์กร เพื่อให้องค์กรมีขีดความสามารถในการแข่งขัน ซึ่งเป็นการผสานกลยุทธ์ทางธุรกิจ เทคโนโลยี และบุคลากรเข้าด้วยกันเพื่อให้เกิดประสิทธิภาพและประสิทธิผลในการดำเนินงาน
(ธงชัย สันติวงษ์, http://www.nationejobs.com/ask/guru_t2_thai.asp?askno=1066)
วิธีการที่องค์กรนำมาใช้เพื่อเป็นเครื่องมือที่จะนำมาสู่การจัดการที่จะให้เกิดห่วงโซ่แห่งคุณค่า (Value Chain) ในองค์กรโดยจะมีการติดตั้งซอฟต์แวร์เพื่อใช้ในองค์กรทั้งหมด ดังนั้นจึงทำให้หน่วยงานทุกหน่วยงานในองค์กรสามารถเข้าถึงข้อมูลที่จัดเก็บอยู่ในฐานข้อมูลอันเดียวกันได้ อาทิเช่น คำสั่งซื้อ (Sales Order) ที่เกิดขึ้นมาหนึ่งคำสั่งจะมีผลต่อหน่วยงานอื่น ๆ โดยอัตโนมัติอาทิเช่น โรงงาน (Manufacturing) , คลังสั่งซื้อ (Inventory) , จัดซื้อ (Procurement) , อินวอยซ์ (Invoice) , ลงบัญชี (Financial ledger) เป็นต้น (http://www.IeaTth.com/Csgroup)
ทุกสิ่งทุกอย่างภายในองค์กรที่ทำให้เกิดผลผลิตขององค์กรได้ สามารถสร้างมูลค่าเพิ่มในสิ่งที่เราทำได้ เช่น การบริการ, การผลิต ที่เราจะเข้าไปแปรสภาพให้ได้มูลค่าเพิ่ม และเราจะจัดการวางแผนทรัพยากรองค์กร (ERP) นี้อย่างไรนั่นเอง การวางแผนทรัพยากรองค์กร (ERP) นี้จำเป็นจะต้องเชื่อมโยงกับซอฟต์แวร์ เพื่อให้การเชื่อมโยงสามารถนำไปจัดการกระบวนการต่าง ๆ ได้ เช่น เพื่อซื้อวัตถุดิบเข้ามา, การรับคำสั่งของลูกค้าให้ถูกต้อง, ส่งมอบสินค้าในเวลาที่ต้องการ ฯลฯ ซึ่งกระบวนการเหล่านี้จะต้องนำคิดเป็นต้นทุน จัดทำเป็นบัญชี โดยการใช้ซอฟต์แวร์เพื่อให้ข้อมูลต่าง ๆ เชื่อมโยงกันทั้งองค์กร และเป็นข้อมูลที่ถูกต้องแม่นยำ และประสานกันเป็นหนึ่งนั่นเอง (ปรีชา พันธุมสินชัย, 2547)
ระบบสารสนเทศในองค์กรวิสาหกิจที่สามารถบูรณาการ (Integrate) รวมงานหลัก (core business process) ต่าง ๆ ในบริษัททั้งหมด ได้แก่ การจัดซื้อจัดจ้าง, การผลิต, การขาย, การบัญชี และการบริหารบุคคล เข้าด้วยกันเป็นระบบที่สัมพันธ์กันและสามารถเชื่อมโยงกันอย่างทันทีทันใด (real time) (อิทธิ ฤทธาภรณ์ และ กฤษดา วิศวธีรานนท์, 2547:7)

Hoạch định tài nguyên doanh nghiệp (tiếng Anh: Enterprise Resource Planning – ERP) nguyên thuỷ ám chỉ một hệ thống dùng để hoạch định tài nguyên trong một tổ chức, một doanh nghiệp. Một hệ thống ERP điển hình là nó bao hàm tất cả những chức năng cơ bản của một tổ chức. Tổ chức đó có thể là doanh nghiệp, tổ chức phi lợi nhuận, tổ chức phi chính phủ v.v.
Một phần mềm ERP, nó tích hợp những chức năng chung của một tổ chức vào trong một hệ thống duy nhất. Thay vì phải sử dụng phần mềm kế toán, phần mềm nhân sự-tiền lương, quản trị sản xuất... song song, độc lập lẫn nhau thì ERP gom tất cả vào chung 1 gói phần mềm duy nhất mà giữa các chức năng đó có sự liên thông với nhau.

Chức năng[sửa | sửa mã nguồn]  Picture showing some typical ERP modulesMột phần mềm ERP cần phải thể hiện được tất cả các chu trình kinh doanh. Việc tích hợp một cách xuyên suốt và từ bỏ các giải pháp cô lập dẫn đến một hệ thống được trung tâm hóa trở lại mà qua đó các tài nguyên có thể được quản lý bởi toàn bộ doanh nghiệp.
Các chức năng tiêu biểu của một phần mềm hoạch định tài nguyên doanh nghiệp bao gồm:
Lập kế hoạch, dự toánBán hàng và quản lý khách hàngSản xuấtKiểm soát chất lượngKiểm soát nguyên vật liệu, kho, tài sản cố địnhMua hàng và kiểm soát nhà cung ứngTài chính – Kế toánQuản lý nhân sựNghiên cứu và phát triểnBên cạnh đó, do tính dây chuyền và phức tạp của hệ thống ERP, các doanh nghiệp cung cấp giải pháp ERP còn hỗ trợ khách hàng thông qua dịch vụ tư vấn, thiết kế theo đặc thù của doanh nghiệp.
Tác dụng[sửa | sửa mã nguồn]Năng suất lao động sẽ tăng do các dữ liệu đầu vào chỉ phải nhập một lần cho mọi giao dịch có liên quan, đồng thời các báo cáo được thực hiện với tốc độ nhanh hơn, chính xác hơn. Doanh nghiệp (DN) có khả năng kiểm soát tốt hơn các hạn mức về tồn kho, công nợ, chi phí, doanh thu, lợi nhuận… đồng thời có khả năng tối ưu hóa các nguồn lực như nguyên vật liệu, nhân công, máy móc thi công… vừa đủ để sản xuất, kinh doanh.
Các thông tin của DN được tập trung, đầy đủ, kịp thời và có khả năng chia sẻ cho mọi đối tượng cần sử dụng thông tin như khách hàng, đối tác, cổ đông. Khách hàng sẽ hài lòng hơn do việc giao hàng sẽ được thực hiện chính xác và đúng hạn. Ứng dụng ERP cũng đồng nghĩa với việc tổ chức lại các hoạt động của DN theo các quy trình chuyên nghiệp, phù hợp với các tiêu chuẩn quốc tế, do đó nó nâng cao chất lượng sản phẩm, tiết kiệm chi phí, tăng lợi nhuận, tăng năng lực cạnh tranh và phát triển thương hiệu của DN.
Ứng dụng ERP là công cụ quan trọng để DN nâng cao năng lực cạnh tranh, đồng thời nó cũng giúp DN tiếp cận tốt hơn với các tiêu chuẩn quốc tế. Một DN nếu ứng dụng ngay từ khi quy mô còn nhỏ sẽ có thuận lợi là dễ triển khai và DN sớm đi vào nề nếp. DN nào chậm trễ ứng dụng ERP, DN đó sẽ tự gây khó khăn cho mình và tạo lợi thế cho đối thủ.
Tuy nhiên, ứng dụng ERP không phải dễ, cần hội tụ nhiều điều kiện để có thể ứng dụng thành công như: nhận thức và quyết tâm cao của ban lãnh đạo DN; cần xác định đúng đắn mục tiêu, phạm vi và các bước triển khai; lựa chọn giải pháp phù hợp; lựa chọn đối tác triển khai đúng; phối hợp tốt với đối tác triển khai trong quá trình thực hiện dự án; sẵn sàng thay đổi các quy trình bất hợp lý hiện hữu trong DN (đây là việc thường xuyên gặp nhiều sự chống đối nhất); chú trọng công tác đào tạo cán bộ theo các quy trình mới; chú trọng đào tạo khai thác hệ thống cho cán bộ mọi cấp; có cán bộ chuyên trách tiếp thu quản trị hệ thống…
Phạm vi chức năng của các phần mềm ERP[sửa | sửa mã nguồn]Một hệ thống ERP có thể bao hàm rất nhiều chức năng trong các lĩnh vực khác nhau. Trong rất nhiều hệ thống ERP, các chức năng đó được đóng gói lại với nhau thành từng bộ và được gọi là các mô đun ERP (ERP modules):
Tài chính - Kế toán: Sổ Nhật ký chung, Tài sản Cố Định, các Khoản Phải trả, Quản lý Tiền mặt, Đối chiếu Sổ sáchKế toán Quản trị: Quản lý ngân sách, Quản lý chi phí, Quản lý các hoạt động phát sinh chi phíQuản lý nguồn nhân lực: Tuyển dụng, Đào tạo, Lương thưởng, Chế độ nghỉ hưu và thai sản, Quản lý linh hoạtSản xuất: Kỹ thuật, Hóa đơn nguyên vật liệu, Lệnh làm việc, Quản lý quy trình, Kiểm soát chất lượng. Quá trình sản xuất nói chung, Quản lý vòng đời sản phẩmQuy trình đặt hàng: Hàng tồn kho, Kho vận, Phân tích và Báo cao bán hàng, Hoa hồng Bán hàngQuản lý chuỗi cung ứng: Kế hoạch chuỗi cung ứng, Cấu
